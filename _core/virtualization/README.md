# Virtualization

The Linaro Virtualization team spans across several Linaro groups and is aimed at providing virtualization (KVM, Xen) and emulation (QEMU) solutions for ARMv7 and ARMv8 hardware as requested by Linaro Members. Primary customers for Virtualization project are LEG and LNG. The direction is set by the Linaro Steering Committee. The team’s work is done by a group of engineers distributed across the world. They are a part of Linaro’s Core Development Engineering Team.

**The virtualization team has many projects that they are working on including:**

- Device assignment/passthrough (platform) for KVM/Xen
- Device assignment/passthrough (PCIe) for KVM/Xen
- Performance Monitoring support for KVM
- ACPI on Xen
- GICv3 support and improvements for both Xen/KVM
- Migration support for KVM on ARMv8-A
- Regular testing and CI loop for ARM virt. technologies
- QEMU EL2/EL3 emulation (TrustZone support)
- Containers
