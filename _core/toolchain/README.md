The Linaro Toolchain works on all aspects of system-level tools - the core development toolchain (compiler, assembler, linker, debugger), core system libraries (dynamic linker, c-library), emulation, profiling and analysis (oprofile, performance events) and instrumentation (ftrace). The team also provides Linaro toolchain binary releases and Linaro Toolchain package releases. Linaro Toolchain works directly with upstream communities: GCC, Binutils, GDB, glibc, LLVM, QEMU.
