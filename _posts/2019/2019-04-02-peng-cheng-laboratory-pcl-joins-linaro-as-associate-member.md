Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm&reg; ecosystem, announced today that Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL) has joined Linaro as an Associate Member.

[PCL](http://szpclab.com/) was founded in 2018 to bring together resources, build scientific infrastructure and carry out collaborative research in the field of AI, network communication and cyberspace security.

Linaro brings together industry and the open source community to collaborate on Arm software. PCL is joining as an Associate Member to benefit from Linaro’s unique collaborative forum as well as Linaro’s expertise in Open Source, Arm and Linux - areas which have been set as strategic directions for the PCL.

Linaro’s Associate Membership Program enables PCL to provide input on technology being developed by key players in the arm ecosystem. It also allows PCL access to the latest development results and Linaro Developer Cloud. Through Developer Cloud, PCL hopes to support software developers and university students wanting to develop Arm software on Arm hardware. &nbsp;

### About Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL)

The establishment of Peng Cheng Laboratory (Shenzhen Cyberspace Laboratory) is a major deployment made by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Government to deeply implement the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and President Xi Jinping's important instructions on the work in Guangdong. It aims at a new round of innovation-driven development needs by setting up a national laboratory “reserve team” and an innovative Guangdong, and promoting the pioneering exploration of the leading area of socialist modernization in Shenzhen.
