In two weeks’ time, we will be hosting Linaro Connect at San Diego Paradise Point, 23-27 September 2019. We are pleased to announce that the Microsoft Azure Sphere team will be joining us, presenting an Azure Sphere IoT Track on Tuesday 24 September. If you are attending Linaro Connect you can register for these sessions by going to [the event schedule](https://connect.linaro.org/schedule/). For those following remotely, Linaro Connect keynotes will be livestreamed on [Linaro’s youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/LinaroOrg/live) and resources for sessions made available by the end of the week on the [Linaro Connect website](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/). Here is a snapshot into what you can expect: 

## How do we keep billions of internet connected devices secure?

Ed Nightingale, Partner Director of Engineering, Microsoft Azure Sphere, will give a keynote on Tuesday 24 September at 10.30am about the challenge of securing billions of devices connected to the internet and what it takes to secure them. Tens of billions of connected devices are controlled by microcontrollers, which are not well prepared for the security challenges posed by internet connectivity. Ed will talk you through Microsoft’s seven properties which it considers the standard for any device connected to the internet.

## Fitting Linux security into 4MiB of RAM

Following on from Ed Nightingale’s keynote there will be a session at 11am led by Ryan Fairfax, Principal Software Engineering Lead, Microsoft Azure Sphere. During this session, Ryan will discuss the challenges of taking modern security techniques and adapting them to resource constrained devices, while going into more technical detail around the security components of Azure Sphere.

## A view from industry: Securing IoT with Azure Sphere

Ed Nightingale will wrap up the Azure Sphere IoT track at 12pm with a technical deep dive session on Azure Sphere. Specifically, Ed will look at the market scenarios Azure Sphere addresses, dig deep into the silicon and software architecture that make up the solution, and review some of the project’s history. What makes Azure Sphere MCU unique from a security perspective? Why is an end-to-end solution to IoT security critical to its success in the market? Attend this session to find out!
