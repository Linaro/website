[San Diego, USA; 23 September 2019] Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm® ecosystem, today announced that NXP Semiconductors® has joined Linaro as a Club member. 

NXP and Linaro have already collaborated extensively. In recent years, they have worked together on IoT & embedded development, secure multimedia encryption, toolchain and 96Boards (the hardware specifications created by Linaro to make the latest Arm-based processors available to developers at a reasonable cost). Together with 96Boards, NXP has launched several boards featuring different SoCs including iMX7, iMX8, LS series silicons and MCUs.

With this new club membership level, NXP will be engaged in the wider set of Linaro collaborative projects including Artificial Intelligence, autonomous vehicles and edge computing, including Time Sensitive Networking (TSN).

“For more than a decade Linaro has played a key role in driving innovation for Arm in open source across many technologies,” said Rob Oshana, Vice President of Software R&D. “Machine Learning, Industrial IoT, and Edge Computing are technologies that are rapidly evolving but require that same collaborative approach to software development. With Linaro, we will be among the companies that are leading the development of software and frameworks that will shape these markets.”

“We are thrilled to see NXP increase its engagement with Linaro,” said Li Gong, Linaro CEO. “Having one of the world’s leading innovators of MCUs actively involved in driving strategy for upcoming markets such as AI and automotive sends a strong message to the Arm ecosystem that collaboration fosters innovation.”

**About Linaro**

Linaro leads collaboration in the Arm ecosystem and helps companies work with the latest open source technology. The company has over 250 engineers working on more than 70 open source projects, developing and optimizing software and tools, ensuring smooth product roll outs, and reducing maintenance costs. Work happens across segments including datacenter & cloud, edge & fog, IoT & embedded, consumer, machine intelligence, telecom & networking, autonomous vehicles, and high performance computing. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low-level fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top ten company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online.
