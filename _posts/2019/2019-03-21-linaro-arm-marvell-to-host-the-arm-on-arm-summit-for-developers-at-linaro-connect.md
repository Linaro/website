Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm® ecosystem, together with Arm and Marvell, is pleased to announce the final schedule [for the Arm on Arm Summit at Linaro Connect Bangkok 2019.](https://connect.linaro.org/) The summit, which features key technology leaders across the industry, aims to encourage diversity of supply from Arm-based hardware vendors while showcasing the value of the world’s largest compute ecosystem.

Experts from Arm, [Gyrfalcon](https://www.gyrfalcontech.ai/), HiSilicon, Linaro, Marvell, Packet, and [Socionext](http://www.socionext.com/en/) will come together at the Centara Grand in Bangkok, Thailand. The Arm on Arm summit will provide attendees with updates and demonstrations on achievements to-date, including the examination of native software development and deployment targeting Arm platforms using Arm-based hosts.

Developers will also see a multitude of Arm-based hardware platforms including laptops, desktops and high-end servers available to them. The event will conclude with a panel of experts from Linaro, Arm, Marvell and Packet hosting a forward-looking discussion detailing upcoming DevOp milestones required to continue to drive seamless system deployments on the Arm architecture.

> “Linaro has played a key role in enabling native development on Arm through many open source technologies ranging from low level firmware and Linux kernel all the way up the application stack
> and including >Datacentre orchestration like OpenStack Powered cloud, in Linaro Developer Cloud.” said Elsie Wahlig, Senior Director of Linaro Datacentre and Cloud Group.  “We are excited to bring
> together so many ecosystem players to showcase all the hard work done so far and discuss next steps.”

> “Arm native development has never been easier,” said Thomas Molgaard, director of Software Technology Management, Arm. “With the emergence of Arm-based laptops, readily available desktop PCs, and
> most recently the Arm Neoverse™ system development platform (SDP), all running the industry’s most widely-used operating systems, developers have a wealth of robust hardware platforms to develop
> for Arm-based solutions.”  

> “The Arm-based server ecosystem is gaining momentum around both open source and commercial software support,” said Larry Wikelius, vice president of Ecosystem and
> Partner Enabling at Marvell Semiconductor, Inc. “Specifically, end users of the Marvell® ThunderX2® 64-bit processor, based on the Armv8-A architecture, are expanding their application deployment
> in areas that include commercial EDA simulation, compute intensive HPC applications and scale-out cloud workloads. Linaro’s significant open source contributions and influence have been key to this
> rapidly proliferating software community.”

The event will kick-off with keynotes from Packet and Socionext, followed by sessions on Arm Neoverse, SUSE, machine learning (ML) for Arm on Arm, and more.
