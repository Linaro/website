The [HiKey Lemaker edition powered by Huawei Kirin620 SoC](http://www.lemaker.org/blog-news-23.html) is now available with Ubuntu Core thanks to the collaboration of Canonical, Huawei and Lemaker. The enablement of Ubuntu Core makes this board the first 64-bit octa-core A53 ARMv8 community development board compatible with Linaro’s 96Boards CE specification.

There will be a live demo of this board at this week’s OSCON in Austin - make sure to check out Huawei and Lemaker’s booth at 501 to see it! 

Also at OSCON is Linaro’s very own Director of Systems - David Mandala - who will be giving an overview on HiKey, the first 64-bit octacore A53 ARMv8 community development board compatible with the Linaro 96Boards CE specification.
