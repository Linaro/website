The Linaro Connect Las Vegas 2016 (LAS16) was one of the largest Connect events to date.  Linaro Connect Las Vegas 2016 (LAS16) was a five-day event full of keynotes by industry leaders, talks, training, hacking and a lot of socializing fun.  Linaro Connect brings together the best and the brightest of the Linux on ARM community and LAS16 was no exception.  The week was full of great keynotes each morning covering many different topics in the community.  There was an announcement of a new segment group at Linaro, the [Linaro IoT and Embedded Group (LITE)](http://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-announces-lite-collaborative-software-engineering-internet-things-iot/).  The Internet of Things (IoT) is disrupting the traditional embedded market and creating huge growth opportunities.  Standards are essential to the success of IoT and the LITE group will bring together ARM ecosystem support for key standards and engineering work to support reliable implementations.
