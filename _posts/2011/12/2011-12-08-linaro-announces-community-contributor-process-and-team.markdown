Today, Linaro announces the formation of the [Linaro Community Contributor Process](https://wiki.linaro.org/CommunityContributor) and [Team](https://wiki.linaro.org/CommunityContributor).

[Linaro](/) itself is now an organisation of around 120 engineers, but as we continue to grow the community around us is also growing fast. We're grateful to the many people who are participating in our success, and so we're introducing the Community Contributor process to recognise those community members who have sustained contributions over a significant period of time. Our Technical Leads now have the opportunity to nominate an individual as a Community Contributor of Linaro.

"When we founded Linaro we had no idea we'd have this amount of engagement and interest from this really broad community of developers interested in Linux on ARM. Interacting with them has been by far the most rewarding part of my role as VP of Engineering (sometimes known as VP of Troublemaking!),” says Linaro’s Engineering VP, Christian Reis. “Officializing the engagement of these engineers and rewarding their participation are important steps that Linaro is undertaking to ensure we run an open forum where multiple (sometimes conflicting) perspectives are considered and converged."

Linaro CTO, David A Rusling, says, "Linaro is a very open and friendly organisation and I'm often asked how people can join in the work that Linaro does. When we first launched Linaro we had the idea of community contributors but felt that we had to build the teams and make an impact before we had the critical mass to support community contributors.  Now I'm glad to say that we can and I'm really looking forward to seeing what happens next."

Zach Pfeffer, Android Platform Tech Lead at Linaro, attributes his motivation and excitement  for encouraging community participation by referencing Linux founder, Linus Torvalds. Pfeffer [paraphrasing Torvalds’ sentiments](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/3/17/492) says, “Linus told the ARM community to get its ass in gear. Linaro answered the call and now with the Linaro Community Contributor process, you can too!”

**The benefits of becoming a Community Contributor will include:**

* a Linaro e-mail address
* the right to carry Linaro business cards (we supply the artwork, you print your own cards)
* a Linaro IRC cloak
* listing in the relevant Working Group on our Linaro organisation structure
* listing in the Launchpad Community Contributors Team

**Applying to be a Linaro Community Contributor is an easy process**.

Community members can apply by requesting a nomination from a Linaro Technical Lead (alternately, the Technical Lead may approach them about the application).

After that they will need to complete and sign our [Community Contributor Agreement](https://wiki.linaro.org/CommunityContributor?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=Linaro_Contributor_Agreement_%28individual%29_25_11_11.pdf).

The main points are that the community contributor agrees to are:

* to our e-mail terms of use, including use of your Linaro e-mail for upstream contributions
* a copyright and patent licence to Linaro for any code you contribute with that e-mail address

Once that's done, the Technical Lead submits the nomination and completed Agreement to our [Community Board](https://wiki.linaro.org/CommunityContributor/CommunityBoard). The nomination will normally describe how the community member has worked with Linaro, any Blueprints they may have been involved with and [Linaro Connect](http://connect.linaro.org/) events they may have attended.

The Community Board then will evaluate all nominations within 2 weeks of submission and all being well the community member will be welcomed as a Community Contributor. We currently have nominations and signed agreements filtering in so this is an exciting time for all of us.

We place a lot of value on having a vibrant network of Community Contributors so this does mean we reserve the right to cancel an appointment at any time if we feel the Contributor is not active in using the above benefits.

**Getting Involved**

[Linaro](/) strives to work as openly and transparently as possible. We also welcome and encourage [community involvement](/hub/). Most of Linaro day-to-day affairs take place on IRC and via public mailing lists. We also use a [public wiki ](https://wiki.linaro.org/)to help document and track much of our work.

Find out you can be part of this exciting and growing community by visiting our [community page](/hub/).
