It's getting real close to the 11.12 release now. We are all putting in a little extra effort. Hardware acceleration will make a huge difference to our platform, and it is happening right now on two of our boards. The other exciting news is that we are introducing support for the [ARM DS-5 debugger](http://www.arm.com/products/tools/software-tools/ds-5/community-edition/index.php). This Eclipse plug-in really [rocks](https://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/DevPlatform/DS5)! Also, we are preparing for the February 2012 "Super Weeks" in San Francisco. First [Linaro Connect](http://connect.linaro.org/), Then [Android Builders Summit]()https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/android-builders-summit/ and finally the [Embedded Linux Conference](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference). See you there!

Here's a list of this weeks major achievements.
