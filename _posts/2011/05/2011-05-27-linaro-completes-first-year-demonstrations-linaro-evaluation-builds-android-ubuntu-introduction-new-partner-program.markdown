CAMBRIDGE, UK - 27 MAY 2011

## Milestone highlights Linaro delivering on its promise to make it easier and quicker to develop open source products


Linaro, a not-for-profit open source software engineering company, is marking its first anniversary with demonstrations of the latest open source software running on its members' hardware at Linaro Developer Summit (LDS) and Computex. The company also announced Linaro Partner Program, an initiative designed to help companies and organizations get involved with Linaro's engineering effort.

Linaro was launched at Computex in 2010 by ARM, IBM, Freescale, Samsung, ST-Ericsson and TI with the mission to create an open source engineering organization that provides aligned engineering and investment into open source projects to reduce fragmentation, increase optimization and make it easier for OEMs and ODMs to develop Linux-based products.


### Key milestones:

	
  * In the first year, Linaro has built a team of more than 100 talented open source developers that have worked on the open source Linux platform on member chips and delivered code upstream that benefits all Linux-based distributions.

	
  * The latest tools, code and optimizations have been used to create Linaro Evaluation Builds for Android and Ubuntu, making it easier for device manufacturers to use Linaro's engineering.

	
  * To help device makers get to market more quickly, Linaro has focused on delivering product quality software and has created the Linaro Automated Validation Architecture (LAVA) platform which runs on a test farm of members' low-cost boards.


The demonstrations at LDS showcased the Android and Ubuntu Linaro Evaluation Builds for the first time and will be extended further at Computex to include new hardware that will be launched at the show.

"The demonstration of Android and Ubuntu Linaro Evaluation Builds and the development of the validation test farm are tangible proof points of the progress Linaro has made on delivering on its mission," said George Grey, Chief Executive Officer of Linaro. "We have delivered consolidation and performance features upstream, worked with our members on support for their latest SoCs, created optimized implementations of popular distributions and focused on the development and testing of product quality software for the benefit of our members."


### Linaro Partner Program

Linaro also announced today the Linaro Partner Program, which is designed to enable companies and organizations to get involved with Linaro's engineering team. The Linaro Partner Program will enable ISVs, software service providers and device manufacturers the ability to embed engineers in Linaro and work together on projects of common interest. This alignment with Linaro will be beneficial to both sides, extending the engineering effort available to Linaro and enabling the sponsoring companies to work with a larger team and build profitable businesses around Linaro's roadmap.

"A year ago, Linaro was formed to enhance open source innovation for the next wave of always-connected, always-on computing," said Chief Operations Officer Stephen Doel. "Today, as we turn 1 year old, we are pleased to share our major achievements as we announce Linaro's Partner Program that will continue to accelerate the depth of engagement from electronics companies and encourage continuous involvement from the wider community."

At launch, the Linaro Partner Program includes Thundersoft, Canonical, Mentor Graphics, Genesi and Collabora. Companies interested in aligning with Linaro and joining the Linaro Partner Program should contact the management team.
