## Summary

	
  * **skia** continues to show monthly improvments.

	
  * **cximage** all toolchains score about the same.

	
  * **gcstone** 4.5 was the only to show improvement over Android. This is slight regression from last month. However, the results from this are biased to the "Total List Alloc Time" test case.

	
  * **gnugo** Shows month-to-month improvement, but 4.5 still outperforms 4.6

	
  * **python** There was a small month-to-month regression in the 2011-09/2011-08 toolchain for 4.6.


The 4.6 graphite optimization "-floop-interchange -floop-strip-mine -floop-block" were more consistent this month than last month.

This chart shows percent improvements against Android 4.4. This was done by comparing theÂ cumulative totals for each benchmark:
