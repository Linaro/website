The Freescale Landing Team wrapped up a week of intensive development at the Freescale Shanghai offices. Called a “Sprint”, the Landing Team locked itself up in a room and made significant headway in forward porting from their current Linaro 2.6.38 kernel to a v3.1 kernel. The team ported most of the key drivers, and resolved many blocking issues. Also  the team contributed to the Linux community by submitting  several SATA and PWM patches to the upstream mailing lists. We expect to see the patches in a future 3.X Linux release.

On Friday evening, the Freescale engineers at the Freescale Shanghai office were invited to learn more about Linaro. The Landing Team demonstrated the Linaro kernel with fully accelerated graphics and multimedia on the [i.MX53 Quickstart board](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=IMX53QSB). The Quickstart board was running xmbc media center to show high quality movies. The session also included a lively in depth  Q&A session where [Eric Miao ](https://wiki.linaro.org/MeetTheTeam#Freescale)and [Usman Ahmad ](https://wiki.linaro.org/MeetTheTeam#Management)explained what Linaro does and how it benefits Freescale. Twenty or so engineers stayed for the full session with many others stopping by for 5-10 mins.

The latest evaluation builds for Freescale i.MX53 (based on Linaro 2.6.38) can be obtained from: [https://wiki.linaro.org/Cycles/1108/Release](https://wiki.linaro.org/Cycles/1108/Release)

Linaro Evaluation Builds for i.MX53 based on v3.1 will be available in the next couple of months.  Stay tuned.
