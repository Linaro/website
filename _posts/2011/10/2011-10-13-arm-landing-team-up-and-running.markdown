The ARM Landing Team is now up and running. This small team consists of Jon Medhurst (Tixy) and Ryan Harkin.

Tixy and Ryan met with their ARM colleagues in Cambridge recently and took delivery of A5 and A9 Versatile Express platforms, Dstream debuggers, tools and code.

The team's Statement of Work is now approved and they are pushing full steam ahead supporting ARM in the Linaro environment. A key priority for the team is supporting Ubuntu and Android developer builds, providing a one click solution for ARM Versatile Express users.

UEFI, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, is also a significant technology that the ARM Landing Team will be focusing its attention on. The UEFI specification is a new model of firmware, providing a standard booting environment for many Operating Systems across many platforms.

Other interesting technologies that the ARM Landing Team will be working with include ARM's DS-5 debugging tools, MALI graphics drivers and support for new ARM platforms as they emerge.
