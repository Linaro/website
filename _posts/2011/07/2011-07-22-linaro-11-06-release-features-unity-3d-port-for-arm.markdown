**The Linaro Team is pleased to announce the release of Linaro 11.06.**

11.06 is the Linaro’s first release delivered on the new monthly cadence. Since we started focusing on monthly component releases, activity in the engineering teams has been channeled into producing a coherent set of packages; This allows anyone to witness development of new features and fixes as the team progresses towards its goals. This month’s release highlights the results: a host of new components are now available, including LAVA packages from the Platform Validation Team, a collection of SoC-specific kernels provided by the Landing Teams, and preview releases of Graphics and Multimedia Working Groups work ranging from Unity 3D to a NEON-optimized libjpeg-turbo. In addition, another solid set of toolchain components, topped by a Linaro GCC 4.6 release that should start making a very good impressions on benchmarks near you.

We encourage everybody to use the 11.06 release. The download links for all images and components are available on our release page:
