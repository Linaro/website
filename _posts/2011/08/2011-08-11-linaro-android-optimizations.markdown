Linaro Connect - Cambridge, UK, August 2011.

Zach Pfeffer, Linaro Android Tech Lead, demonstrates two Panda boards running Android. On the right, there's Google's Android, built with the gcc 4.4 toolchain provided by Google, and the [Pandroid](http://code.google.com/p/pandroid/) kernel. On the left, there is a Linaro build, using Linaro's gcc 4.5 toolchain, and Linaro's 3.0 kernel for the Panda board.

You will see that there is a noticeable difference in the time taken by both boards to execute the demo.

You can test the latest Android Linaro builds for the Panda board by following instructions on [this blog post](/blog/linaro-android-build-service-video/), or by downloading our [latest monthly release](/downloads/).
