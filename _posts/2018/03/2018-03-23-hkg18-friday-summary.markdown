# Highlights of the fifth day at Linaro Connect HKG18

We started the fifth and final day of Linaro Connect with two keynotes from Dileep Bhandarkar from Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies and Dr Laura Dekker.

Dileep Bhandarkar from Qualcomm gave a keynote on the emerging computing trends in the data centre. He specifically talked about how the process node is now driven by mobile usage rather than PC usage, a shift which Qualcomm has been able to take advantage of, designing for energy efficiency and scaling up. The key lesson from the shift towards mobile is that it is possible to be energy efficient at lower power without sacrifysing competitive performance.

Following Dileep's keynote we had Dr Laura Dekker talk about what it is like to be an artist working in the field of Open Source. The past decade has seen a wide range of resources for artists such as Python and C++ libraries for natural language processing and biological simulation. Laura examined the different capacities there are for expression through computation, using her own artwork to show the audience examples of how she used Opensource.

After the keynotes we had a few sessions on topics such as the New Linaro Enterprise Lab, QEMU in UEF and HPC Compiler Quality.  Videos and slides will be uploaded on the [Resources page](https://connect.linaro.org/hkg18/resources/) shortly. We then finished the week on a high with Demo Friday where we saw some fantastic showcases on Arm technology.

Thank you to everyone who submitted sessions, presented keynotes and contributed in general to a fantastic week at Linaro Connect Hong Kong 2018. We would also like to extend a special thank you to our sponsors Arm, Fujitsu, Hoperun and Red Hat.

The next Linaro Connect (YVR18) will take place in Vancouver, 17-23 September 2018. We will launch registration in April. Hope to see you at YVR18!
