**Keeping up with LTS: Linux Kernel Functional Testing (LKFT) on Devices, Thomas Gall, Linaro**

Linaro Mobile Group’s (LMG) Director Tom Gall will talk about Linux Kernel Functional Testing on Devices. LMG has been working to improve testing on embedded devices with the goal to catch regressions as quickly as possible during the LTS RC test cycle and increase confidence that consumer devices are able to upgrade to the latest LTS. As Director of Linaro Mobile Group, Tom oversees collaborative engineering involving Android and the Linux Kernel by a wide range of SoC vendors, handset vendors and Google.

Tuesday 13 March, 4.20-5.10pm

**A Solution to High Latencies Caused by I/O, Paolo Valente, Linaro**
In his session, Paolo Valente will look at the BFQ I/O scheduler which, since making its way into the Linux kernel, has brought high responsiveness, low latency for time-sensitive applications and strong fairness. In particular, he will demonstrate through demos and stats, the benefits to come, comparing them with the current latency and unfairness problems of Linux-based embedded systems. Paolo is a Linaro Engineer and Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy. His main focus is on scheduling algorithms for storage devices, transmission links and CPUs.
