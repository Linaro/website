Earlier today, [Linaro Community Projects Division, the division of Linaro managing open source community projects, announced the Trusted Firmware open governance project](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/news/linaro-community-projects-division-announces-the-trusted-firmware-open-project/). Â The Trusted Firmware project is designed to reduce porting and integration work across the ecosystem by creating reusable reference implementations for SoC and Trusted OS developers at[ trustedfirmware.org](http://trustedfirmware.org/).

It provides a reference implementation of Secure World software for Armv7, Armv8-A and Armv8-M architectures. This means that SoC developers and OEMs now have a reference trusted code base complying with the relevant Arm specifications. 

Membership is open to both Linaro members and non-members, with governance being overseen by a board of member representatives. This board currently consists of Arm, Texas Instruments, Google LLC, Cypress Semiconductor and Linaro. Data I/O joins the project as a General Member.
