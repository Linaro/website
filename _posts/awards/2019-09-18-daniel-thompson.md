bio: >
    I joined a toolset team from university and have been working in and around tools and operating systems ever since. As the world moved from real-time threading libraries to Linux I went with it. I worked on many kernel and media driver projects whilst working for ST. Initially on SH4 and later on ARM as well. More recently I have been working on porting NMI features from x86 to arm and arm64.
