bio: >
    I first used Linux back when you downloaded floppy images over a 14.4kbps modem. I've done Linux kernel development since 2004 working at Calxeda, Freescale, and Motorola. I've done a variety of device drivers and core SOC support code. Currently, I'm one of the kernel DeviceTree maintainers.
