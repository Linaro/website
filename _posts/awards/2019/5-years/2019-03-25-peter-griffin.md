bio: >
    "I've been writing low level embedded software on Linux for a living since 2007 and before that as a hobbyist. Professionally first at an embedded Linux consultancy where I worked extensively doing SoC and board bringups, either for the silicon vendor or OEM custom hardware. In particular I worked a lot with Renesas SH2A/SH4 chipsets and TI (Davinci / OMAP), and an architecture port to CR16C+. Since 2010 I've been working at ST on their range of STB chipsets, in particular their new DVB stack SDK2, where my main contributions were SMP ARM enablement of multimedia drivers , AVSync within Dolby specs, PlayReady DRM, LinuxDVB HW demux, demodulator and tuners and power management across the stack to overcome thermal issues. I also got involved with customer support, occasionally on site."
