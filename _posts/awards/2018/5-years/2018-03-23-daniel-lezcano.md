# bio: >
#     Long time systems and embedded developer with a side of Dynamic Binary Translation.

#     Alex started learning to program in the 80s in an era of classic home computers that allowed you to get down and dirty at the system level. After graduating with a degree in Chemistry he's worked on a variety of projects including Fruit Machines, Line Cards, CCTV recorders and point-to-multipoint wireless microwave systems. Since the turn of the century his primary focus has been working with FLOSS platforms, especially Linux. An alumni of Transitive he has a broad experience of cross-platform virtualization as well as a strong background in telecommunications and networking. A keen Emacs user he will happily answer questions and proselytise for the One True Editor (tm).
