We are proud to announce the release of our newly redesigned website. It has been redesigned to give you a more consolidated and easier to navigate site to keep up with the latest activities taking place at Linaro.

Immediately you will notice streamlined menus, simple navigation and access to the information you want about Linaro’s status. By providing an improved destination for engineers and business’ to learn about Linaro, we have designed the new website as a resource hub.  The new site has taken the content that you want to know and made it easier to access than ever.  We have reduced the redundancy of having to look in multiple places for Linaro information made it possible for you now to access our content both on and off our site in one place by providing links to all the other Linaro sites where you can get more information, for example, all of our social media links to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LinaroOrg), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linaroorg), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+LinaroOnAir), [YouTube,](https://www.youtube.com/user/linaroorg?sub_confirmation=1) [YouTube onair ](https://www.youtube.com/user/linaroOnAir?sub_confirmation=1)and [News](/resources/) can be found at the bottom of every page.  Links to the [engineering wiki ](https://wiki.linaro.org/FrontPage)are now found under developers and projects to get the latest team updates.  In the events section we have added our presentations to [Slideshare ](http://www.slideshare.net/linaroorg/)as well as all the photos of our events are shared with a link to our [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/linaroorg/sets/72157641218034675/) page.  By consolidating all the content into easy to find single locations you can be sure you are always viewing the latest and greatest information Linaro has to offer.
