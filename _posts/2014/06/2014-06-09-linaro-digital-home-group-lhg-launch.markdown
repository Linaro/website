On May 29th, Linaro [publicly announced](/news/leaders-digital-home-solutions-collaborate-linaro-arm-linux-platforms/) the formation of LHG with the founding member companies (see also an announcement from [Cisco](http://blogs.cisco.com/sp/why-were-joining-the-linaro-digital-home-group/)).

LHG will focus on supporting the proliferation of ARM processors and open source software in digital home applications, including IP/Cable set-top boxes, televisions, media boxes and home gateway devices.

The formation of LHG provides a unique opportunity for founding members to be part of the growing wave of companies leveraging open source software on ARM-based SoCs to deliver home media solutions with accelerated time to market.  LHG will serve as a focal point in the home media industry segment and enables cross-industry participants to participate in defining the future innovations on leading platforms.

LHG members will work together on fundamental software platforms, such as Android and the Linux-based Reference Design Kit (RDK) to enable rapid deployment of new services on digital home platforms.  At the foundation of the platforms required for diverse multimedia applications lies an enhanced core Linux software platform for digital home devices.  All development work will be carried out on LHG member hardware.

The roadmap is currently being defined by the LHG Steering Committee and covers key technical topics in the set-top and TV segments.  The major areas LHG will focus on initially:  using the Linaro Stable Kernel ([LSK](https://wiki.linaro.org/LSK)) as the common core Linux platform underlying Android and RDK; security solutions based on ARM TrustZone® supporting Digital Rights Management (DRM) via W3C Encrypted Media Extensions (EME); improvements/optimizations to media frameworks (initially focusing on Android & RDK); open source DLNA CVP-2 implementation; and optimized HTML5.
