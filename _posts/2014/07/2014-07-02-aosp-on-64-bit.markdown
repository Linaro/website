## Armv8-A architecture enablement to accelerate with silicon and software availability


CAMBRIDGE, UK; 2 JULY 2014

Following the recent announcement of the Android™ L Developer Preview, Linaro, the collaborative engineering organization developing open source software for the Arm® architecture, today announced that a build of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) to the Armv8-A architecture has been made available as part of the Linaro 14.06 release. This build has been tested on an Armv8-A 64-bit hardware development platform, code-named “Juno”, available from Arm for lead and ecosystem partners.

The Linaro Armv8-A reference software stack combined with the Arm Development Platform (ADP) provides the Arm ecosystem with a foundation to accelerate Android availability on 64-bit silicon. This announcement is the culmination of a broad architecture enablement program carried out by Linaro, Arm and the Arm partnership. Arm partners now have access to a broad range of supporting material including the Armv8 Fast Models, open source toolchain from Linaro and supporting documentation.

“The Arm ecosystem is rapidly preparing for the benefits a 64-bit Arm architecture will bring to devices starting this year,” said James McNiven, general manager of systems and software at Arm. “Our collaboration with Linaro will enable our partners to create 64-bit devices that will drive the best next-generation mobile experience on Android operating systems,while also providing full compatibility with today’s 32-bit mobile ecosystem that is optimized on Arm-v7A.”

The Linaro 14.06 release includes a 64-bit primary/32-bit secondary binary image and source code based on the Linaro Stable Kernel (LSK) 3.10 for Android, compiled with GCC 4.9 and tested on both the Armv8-A 64-bit hardware platform and Armv8-A Fast Models. The AOSP is based on the Open Master snapshot downloaded on June 1st with HDMI drivers loaded as modules. The release is built with the Android runtime (ART) compiler as the default virtual machine. Peripheral and advanced power management support plus several accelerations will not be available in this release, but will follow in future releases on a monthly cadence.

“We have been using Arm Fast Models to develop for AOSP for a long time and it is testament to the quality of our collaborative engineering that we have delivered this release running on the Armv8-A hardware platform so quickly,” said George Grey, Linaro CEO. “We look forward to working closely with our members to enable them to deliver next generation Android solutions rapidly to the market.”

The Armv8-A hardware development platform includes an SoC with a quad-core Arm Cortex®-A53 CPU and dual-core Arm Cortex-A57 CPU in an Arm big.LITTLE™ processing configuration with a quad-core Arm Mali™-T624 GPU linked via Arm CoreLink™ system IP and implemented using Arm Artisan® physical IP. The development platform with its Armv8-A software stack provides Arm software and silicon partners with a common foundation to accelerate their Armv8-A software development.
