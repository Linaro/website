title: Review of Thursday at LCA14 - "Team Day"
wordpress_id: 3532
---

LCA14 on Thursday was unofficially themed “Team Day”.  Unlike the other days of Connect Asia, Thursday did not begin with a keynote, instead we decided to have a lively panel discussion on “[Best Practices working in a Distributed Environment”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UdqAjAoD3A).  The panel discussed how Linaro operates with people spread over 30 different countries; including best practices to communicate with a global team, staying motivated and handling distractions.


Once the panel discussion concluded it was on to the sessions of the day.  The sessions included some topic areas not covered earlier in the week such as Testing a secure framework, GPGPU, Big Endian, Chromium optimization and profiling. We did not stream out our sessions live on Thursday but don’t worry we do have the presentations from most of the sessions below.  Along with sessions there was also all day hacking in the team rooms.  This was to let teams have some extra time in the week to get together and accomplish some of the goals they set out at the beginning of the week.

Finally, as mentioned in yesterday’s blog, on Wednesday was ![12964345785_25fdc34be4](/assets/blog/12964345785_25fdc34be4.jpg)Linaro’s “Bond Themed” gala.  The evening gave everyone a chance to get in on the fun of dressing as their favorite Bond character.  We had many beautiful bond girls and dapper James Bond’s at the event, along with a few villains and some “inventive” costumes.  There was a backdrop to the movies to help get into the action.  Below are some of the images from that night.
