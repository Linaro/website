Day two of Linaro Connect USA 2014 highlighted the digital home and began with a keynote address entitled “Enabling Internet Speed for Service Providers” from Cisco’s CTO Connected Devices and SP Video Infrastructure, [Ken Morse.](https://connect.linaro.org/lcu14/)  He focused on the changes to the architecture of video delivery and the role of the set-top in the digital connected home. Following the keynote, there was a presentation from a DLNA ambassador on secure delivery of Pay TV content throughout the connected home.   If you are interested in learning more about any of these keynotes or sessions below are links to more information.

### **Below are the Summaries of the Sessions that took place on Tuesday**


**Keynote - LHG: Ken Morse – Cisco** Dr. Ken Morse, summarized the disruption that is happening in the video space, particularly with regard to the opportunities offered by Cloud based services. These opportunities included delivering new services to market more quickly with less disruption to users, application portability and big data and analytics.  He also discussed the advantages of switching from a conventional DVR to a Cloud based one.

The second part of his keynote covered new technologies driving Video delivery in the home.  He discussed the next generation video encoding for Ultra HD – HEVC, the move to all-IP, for content delivery and EPG / user experience, improved WiFi  supporting high-quality video delivery throughout the home, DOCSIS 3.1, Set top operators embracing RDK and new  home gateway devices.

**LCU14-200: Delivering Pay TV Content Throughout the Connected Home** The session began by outlining the benefits of Vidi-Path technology - an enhancement based on DLNA technology that allows subscription TV content to be shared across multiple video devices in the home.  In the later part of the session an overview of the CVP-2 specification features.

**LCU14-201: Binary Analysis Tools** During the session there was a presentation that covered currently available binary analysis tools, including: Sanitizers, perf, record/replay and prelink rootfs.  In addition to the material presented in the slide deck there was quite a bit of discussion on the topics of sanitizers and gdb reverse debugging. The session the included reviewing each of the sanitizers and then discussed the role of sanitizers, the strengths, implementation characteristics and limitations each.  There was a question on why one should use sanitizers over Valgrind was posed.  The given answer was 1) sanitizers are much more performant and 2) in the case of address sanitizer, the compiler can optimize away some checks using compiler knowledge.  The session concluded with a discussion onhow the sanitizer libraries are implemented.

**LCU14-203: LAVA Use Cases: Upstream Kernel CI** This session started with Linaro describing a system that they are building from the ground up, focused on upstream Kernel CI.  The system is still in a pilot mode and they are examining the upstream kernel boot testing needs with a pilot / ‘un-burdened’ system.  Further discussions are planned to brainstorm and discuss the appropriate next steps.

**LCU14-205: Multi-arch compiler driver** This session started as a discussion of problems that member companies currently have with deploying systems that use compilers in the Arm ecosystem.  A proposal for a multi-arch compiler driver morphed into a multi-pronged proposal for a solution.   Some of the problems were discussed in detail during the session.  A collective solution was discussed and the proposal is that Linaro will work to help OE (OpenEmbedded) to enable multiple compilers.  Linaro proposed finishing the GCC moduralization project which will split middle-end and back-end dependence on shared macros.  Finally Linaro will investigate splitting out thumb1 backend from arm backend because this may decrease maintenance

**LCU14-206: Power Management Analysis Tools** This session introduced the audience to the workload generator tool to allow simulation of arbitrary workloads and idlestat to analyse scheduling and resultant power behavior. The workload generator will be used to provide upstream kernel maintainers ways to generate workloads of interest to test patch submissions against. Idlestat is already useful to indicate differences in the C-state and P-state behaviors on a system but the reporting format could use some redesign. The next goal is to add support to describe an energy model for the SoC and to experiment with several reporting formats.

**LCU14-207: LAVA status update and refactoring the lava-dispatcher** A summary was given of the status followed by an open discussion to look at existing or uncovered use-cases with the lava-dispatcher refactoring.  Key topics discussed included, the ability to embed test definitions into the log file, action-specific log files, secure pipeline steps, actions and jobs.

**LCU14-208: Chromium-Blink migration for RDK** This was a technical session featuring a deep dive into the Chromium-Blink migration implementing Ozone-Aura graphics framework Linaro.

**LCU14-209: LLVM Linux** The session began with a discussion on the current state of changes to LLVM and Linux kernel.  Following that discussion there was lots of discussion around inline assembly issues and the things which need addressing in order to enable the use of the integrated assembler in clang instead of using as from binutils. Most of the remaining issues involve changing kernel code to use C99 constructs or finding solutions which will work equally with both gcc and clang.

**LCU14-210: Qualcomm Snapdragon Power Management - Unique challenges to the power frameworks** Qualcomm walked the attendees through the Qualcomm SoC architecture with a special emphasis on the power management architecture. The key takeaway from the talk was the workarounds needed to upstream frameworks to make it useful for Qualcomm products. The four key issues raised were: lack of hierarchical idle states in cpuidle, runtime enabling/disabling of idle states, per-CPU PM-QoS (patches posted for upstream inclusion) and an event timer framework that can be used in parallel with PM-QoS to maximise deep states w/o being restricted by QoS constraints. There were lots of audience questions on the need for these features and discussions on if there were ways to do this with existing frameworks. Over time, some of these enhancements will be posted upstream.

**LCU14-211: LAVA Use Cases: SW testing & Reproducing a LAVA failures locally using CARE -** In this session, an assignee, reviewed how he is using LAVA to perform PRoot (an opensource project) testing and some of the extensions he has created for artifact publishing and reproducing LAVA failures using CARE (an extension to PRoot).

**LCU14-115: Security Best Practices- (also listed as LCU14-212)** This session acted as a reminder of some of the digital security threats that face Linaro and its work in the Linux ecosystem. It covered some fairly basic best-practices for developers new to working in opensource and outside of the corporate firewall, including password rules, two-factor authentication, password managers, insecure communication methods, and securing your system. As well as more advanced topics for developers like using ssh keys, ssh key management, ssh best practices, extra considerations for securing your development system, and gpg/pgp secure email. Also it pointed to the wiki, where all of the info and links discussed can be found, and where further tips and pointers should be added: [https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/Process/DevSecurityBestPractices](https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/Process/DevSecurityBestPractices)

**LCU14-509: Overview of qa-reports** The session included a presentation of existing features in qa-reports.linaro.org. It also highlighted the problems that were found during development process. It was identified that there is a certain amount of overlap between qa-reports, LAVA and Uptream kernel CI.  It was decided that more discussion needs to happen between QA, LAVA and stakeholders to identify the common denominator features that should be implemented in the basic reporting system.
