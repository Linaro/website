Linaro Connect USA 2014 began yesterday in Burlingame, California with over 500 attendees. Mobile was the theme for the day and began with an opening keynote by Linaro's CEO, George Grey titled "Linaro’s past, present and future". Following Mr Grey was [Paul Eremenko](https://connect.linaro.org/lcu14/), Direct of Project Ara at Google who gave a keynote titled “What if hardware was more like software? Google’s Project Ara and the democratization of the hardware ecosystem”. 

After the keynotes there were sessions about ART, Android on Armv8-A SoCs, a panel discussion on a more open AOSP, power management, Coresight, QEMU and security. The latter of these topics also had a couple of sessions on the open source trusted execution environment (TEE) that ST has released with Linaro’s assistance. Later in the afternoon introductory sessions on a variety of topics including ODP, upstreaming, Xen and ACPI, and embedded systems were given. If you are interested in learning more about any of these keynotes or sessions below are links to more information.

### Below are the summaries of the sessions that took place on Monday:


**LCU14-100: Dalvik is Dead, Long Live Dalvik!** This session covered the architecture of Dalvik and ART. It covered past Arm engineering efforts starting with Dalvik and how it was ported by the Arm team to AARCH64. The session touched on a number of the issues faced before ultimately having most of the work being thrown into the dustbin with the rise of ART. Some of the compiler work from Dalvik was saved this was summarized to wrap up the talk.

**LCU14-101: Coresight Overview** This session concentrated on the introduction of the coresight technology and how it is used to provide HW assisted tracing on Arm SoCs.  After a short overview of the advantages offered by HW assisted tracing and the advance trace scenarios it can support the framework and drivers currently being upstreamed by Linaro were presented.  The session ended with a walk through the minimal steps required to trigger and collect trace data using the framework.

**LCU14-102: PMWG lightning talks** This was a catch-all session with the goal to make attendees aware of smaller projects that don’t get highlighted, but are important to invest in. Some examples are the work in the community maintaining various frameworks, build-and-boot test farms for mainline kernels and reviewing patches all across the power management core frameworks. A lot of interest was expressed in our work on adding hibernation support on Arm32. With Juno, there is a possibility that the PSCI firmware will support hibernation (it’s not there yet) and might make an interesting target for a reference hibernation implementation. It’ll depend on the upstreaming of Juno support and the provision of a capable firmware.

**LCU14-103: How to create and run Trusted Applications on OP-TEE** The first part of this session was a walkthrough of the GlobalPlatform APIs that are used when communicating with the secure world. Five important functions were introduced: TEEC_InitializeContext, TEEC_OpenSession, TEEC_InvokeCommand, TEEC_CloseSession and TEEC_FinalizeContext. The second part of the session was a short demo that showed how to boot up FVP and run a “Hello World” Trusted Application.

**LCU14-104: Everything’s Done! Android on 64-bit Armv8, What’s next ?** A long to do list for Android on Armv8 exists and this session introduced progress to date and a list of possible areas to explore. Subsequent meetings between Linaro and members have then discussed  each topic and the results of those discussions are shared separately.

**LCU14-105: Coresight Advanced Topics** After a short recapitulation of "coresight 101" the API used to enhance the coresight framework with support for new components was presented.  The second half of the discussion concentrated on the problems currently inherent to the coresight technology and possible ways to alleviate them.

**LCU14-106: QEMU for Armv8 and the AArch64 Android Emulator** The first part of this session was a summary of the Armv8 System and Instruction emulation support on QEMU. Debug architecture support is almost complete, but there are certain architecture features not used by GDB and ptrace which are being deferred. PSCI support patches have been revived and are ready to be merged. TrustZone patches to support EL2 and EL3 for both Armv8 and Armv7 are available from several contributors and we are looking to have support upstream in QEMU soon.

The second part of the session was about the Android emulator support in QEMU. The older Android emulator was introduced and it was explained that attempts to backport upstream Armv8 support to the Android emulator have been abandoned. Linaro has created a ‘Ranchu’ branch based on the -M virt board and Virtio. Linaro will send the patches upstream soon. Work is underway to establish this as the foundation for the future Android emulator and longer term there may be a transition into an upstream solution. The session concluded with a short intro on how to run Armv8 images on QEMU, and pointed to a more descriptive blog post from the Linaro Core group’s ‘Core Dump’ blog.

**LCU14-107: OP-TEE on Armv8** This session introduced the work that has been done on OP-TEE for Armv8-A and it covered the interaction between Linux kernel driver for OP-TEE and the Trusted OS where the so called Secure Monitor acts as a bridge between the two worlds. The dispatcher that has been created to be able to use OP-TEE together with Arm Trusted Firmware was then described.

The audience had questions about the Linux kernel driver. For example they wondered if there’s a need for different drivers for different platforms. The answer to that was generally no. On the same topic, it was mentioned that no changes has been done in the Linux kernel driver when porting OP-TEE to FVP (and also QEMU). The audience also asked about delivery dates. There were two answers. First the speakers mentioned that STMicroelectronics has been working on creating a new Linux kernel driver for this, a driver that is better partitioned with a general part and a more dedicated part. This updated version is what the Linaro Security Working Group has been waiting for and they hope to have access soon.

**LCU14-108: Faster, Better and more Open AOSP Support** This was a discussion session around various viewpoints on AOSP issues, such as how could additional boards be added to upstream AOSP. Answer. Google would rather Linaro have its own repo for this, but the question of how to encourage companies that author their own set of patches to contribute them was raised. The Linaro Mobile Group (LMG) took away two action items. Firstly, to find a neutral conference to host discussions and to enable an active AOSP community. Secondly, to find a hardware platform and maintain it on the Linaro GIT repository with a call for submissions and patches to be reviewed and, after approval, pushed to AOSP.

**LCU14-109: Embedded Systems: How Low Can You Go?** This was a lively presentation and discussion session that looked at the question of smaller embedded systems and how to support them moving forward. Topics included how much longer Arm7TDMI would need to be actively supported, how much work should be done around Cortex-M, and the importance of kernel size.

**LCU14-110: Xen and ACPI: Status and challenges** Xen cannot parse AML and read device information from the DSDT and can therefore only read static tables in ACPI. Additionally, Xen needs to be able to hide devices from Dom0. This session reviewed the problem and current state of solutions. Issues were identified, discussed and a way forward decided. A spec suggestion and code to support the new approach will now be developed. The session then moved into a discussion of upstreaming between Linaro and Xen, concluding with a lengthy discussion concerning platform power management.

**LCU14-111 ODP Project Update** This session provided an update of ODP giving particular attention to activity in the last six months, since LCA14. Various implementations and the state of APIs as we move towards ODP v1.0 delivery for 4Q14 delivery were discussed. The session concluded with a look at the uses of ODP and the demos that will be shown as part of LNG Demo Thursday.

**Afternoon hacking sessions** All the teams established themselves in their hacking rooms with the teams getting to know each other and beginning the week’s engineering work. Results of this will be shared on Friday.
