Linaro Connect ([LCE 12 - Copenhagen](http://connect.linaro.org/resources/)) is just around the corner and with a little over one month until the event we are pleased to announce the call for demonstrations is now open. The Demo Friday event will take place on Friday 2 November at the Bella Center, in Copenhagen, Denmark as part of LCE 12 Copenhagen.
