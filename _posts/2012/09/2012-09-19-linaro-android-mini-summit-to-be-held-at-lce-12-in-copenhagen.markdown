As mentioned in [early posts](/blog/linaro-android-armv864bit-and-big-little-mini-summits-to-be-held-at-lce-12-copenhagen/) about [LCE 12 Copenhagen](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/), this Linaro Connect will host three mini-summits - tracks focused on a single strategic topic held on a single day from 8.30am until lunchtime. There will be an Armv8 (64-bit) mini-summit on the Tuesday 30 Oct, an Android mini-summit on the Wednesday 31 Oct and a big.LITTLE mini-summit Thursday 1 Nov.


[Zach Pfeffer](/about/), Linaro Android Tech Lead took a few minutes out of his day [to answer a few questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN3XqjlA-4k) about the this mini summit and what you can expect out of this event.   He also invites those in attendance to join the afternoon hacking sessions and continue the interactive experience with the [Linaro Android Team](https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/Platform/Android).

Pfeffer also mentioned that the the preliminary topics include:

  * Optimization Opportunities
    * Introduction using the benchmark driven
    * Power improvements

  * Unification of Android and generic Linux
    * Embedded Android, in car audio, set top boxes
    * Kernel upstreaming


Pfeffer was also quick to point out that these are preliminary topics and as such are subject to change.  So check the [schedule](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/#schedule) as we get closer to the start of Connect for the final list of agenda and topic items.
