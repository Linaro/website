SEOUL, KOREA AND CAMBRIDGE, UK - 26 OCT 2012

Consumer electronics leader LG Electronics and Linaro, the not-for-profit engineering organization develop-ing open source soft-ware for the ARM architecture, today announced that LG will join Linaro to cooperate on new ARM technologies.

LG will contribute resources to work together with the resources from existing Linaro members. This shared team of over 100 engineers is directed by a Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which now includes LG. Through the TSC, Linaro members are de-fining the future of Linux on ARM. Accelerated time to market for new ARM technologies is achieved by working together within Linaro on shared solutions, while focusing members' in-house engineering resources on differentiation.

Linaro uses a unique business model where multiple companies create core open source software once with a shared investment in a single software engineering team, rather than by creating multiple, fragmented software solutions in isolation. Membership delivers an immediate return on investment as new members get immediate access to a significant engineering team.

"We are pleased to join Linaro as its newest member,” said Bo-ik Sohn, Senior Vice President for LG Electronics R&D Lab. “We will take an active role in the organization and actively cooperate on new ARM technologies with other Linaro members."

"We are very pleased to welcome LG Electronics as a Linaro member," said George Grey, Linaro CEO. "With Linaro continuing to enable shared member investment on consolidation and optimization of Linux and Android on ARM, as well as working on new ARM technologies such as big.LITTLE and next-generation 64-bit devices, we are excited to have LG Electronics working closely with us."
