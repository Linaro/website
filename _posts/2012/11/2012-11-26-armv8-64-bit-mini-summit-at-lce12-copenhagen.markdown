> Armv8—we can do that; it’s all in the open now, the code’s been published. ~David Rusling, Linaro CTO

Linaro held [three mini-summits](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/) during its [Linaro Connect Europe 2012 (LCE12)](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/) event at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Denmark on 29 October through 2 November. In this post we are taking a look at the Armv8 (64-bit) Mini-Summit that ran on 30 October.

First time Linaro Connect attendee, Andrew Thoelke of Arm ran the Armv8 (64-bit) Mini Summit which kicked off at 8:30 am with introductory and lightning-talk plenary sessions. The plenary sessions were both a “welcome” to the summit and a “here’s what to expect” outline of the event.

This mini-summit was an in-depth discussion about the status of open source software for [Armv8’s 64-bit execution state (AArch64)](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/fixed-virtual-platforms) and what the next steps for this should be.

Topics discussed during this event included:

  * The current state of Armv8 (64-bit), what has been released and what is happening


  * Planning the next quarter’s work in Linaro including blueprints and various requirements for the continuous integration (CI) loop for 64-bit tools (gcc 4.7 etc.), CI loop for 64-bit kernel and the LAMP stack based on Open Embedded.


  * Various ways to coordinate the kernel activities for 32- and 64-bit architectures and platforms as well the 64-bit bring-up of Linux distributions.


  * How to enable the wider development community to get involved with Armv8 (64-bit) development.


[In an interview](http://youtu.be/6bkfk3HAsH0), at LCE12-Copenhagen, [David Rusling, Linaro CTO](/about/) said, “Armv8—we can do that; it’s all in the open now, the code’s been published. We’ve been building stuff, [...] we pulled Armv8 into our Continuous Integration (CI) cycle and we’ve got stuff on the web, so you can go download the tools and we’ve starting working with it.” Rusling summarized, “We’ve had a lot of good discussions around moving forwards, next steps, testing, improvements. [...] how we organize the kernel, so platform support is really clean.”

A common theme that ran through all four of these sessions was the enablement and building of a community around the Armv8 (64-bit) architecture.

Various Linux distributions are already working on porting their software to the new architecture.  Linaro is set to coordinate and help with cross-distro compatibility testing, with planning done via the existing Linaro [cross-distro mailing list.](http://lists.linaro.org/mailman/listinfo/cross-distro)
