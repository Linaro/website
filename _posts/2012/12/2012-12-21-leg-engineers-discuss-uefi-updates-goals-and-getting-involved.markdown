A UEFI Mini-Sprint was held at the Linaro offices in Cambridge UK on 11-13 December.

[Rony Nandy](/about/), Enterprise Server Engineer for the [Linaro Enterprise Group](/engineering/datacenter-and-cloud/) (LEG) summed up the Sprint in a [blog post this week](/blog/uefi-mini-sprint-at-cambridge-from-11-13-dec-2012/). Nandy writes in his post that during the this mini-sprint problems such as a location for all the board support for edk2(UEFI) on Arm were fixed.  The maintainer-ship structure for UEFI on Arm was also discussed and goals for UEFI on Arm in 2013 were put in motion.

LEG Engineers held [a public Hangout on Air](http://youtu.be/hSnXW3DjQ4I) where they discussed UEFI updates, future goals and how to get involved.



Participants for this hangout included [Andrea Gallo](/about/), Director of LEG who opened the Hangout and facilitated the discussion. [David Rusling](/about/), Linaro, CTO gave feedback and [Grant Likely](/about/), Technical Architect discussed the various goals that were achieved at the mini-sprint.

Engineers from and Arm and Linaro had the opportunity to add their thoughts and insights to the discussion. From Arm were Leif Lindholm  and Olivier Martin with [Ryan Harkin](/about/), Tech Lead for the Arm Landing Team and  [Anmar Oueja](/about/), Technical Program Manager from Linaro rounding out the Hangout.

The formation of LEG was [announced](/news/industry-leaders-collaborate-to-accelerate-software-ecosystem-for-arm-servers-and-join-linaro/) in early November.  As part of the announcement initial work and goals were outlined.  "Linaro expects initial software delivery before the end of 2012 with ongoing releases thereafter," and yesterday [LEG announced](/blog/linaro-enterprise-group-leg-releases-its-12-12-engineering-preview/) it meet that goal and released its [Engineering Preview](https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/LEG/Engineering/Releases/12.12).

UEFI is only one [part of the roadmap](https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/LEG#Scope_of_Work) that [LEG](/engineering/datacenter-and-cloud/) will be working on in 2013.
