Linaro is excited to announce that we will once again be having our Demo Friday at Linaro Connect Q1.12 to show the latest Linux developments on Arm. Linaro members, partners and community offer interactive demonstrations showcasing Arm-processor-based boards and Linaro builds of Android and Ubuntu.

Demo Friday is a two-hour event that will showcase new and innovative ways Linaro members, partners and community are using Linaro Builds of Ubuntu and Android on Arm processor-based boards. Demo Friday will take place on Friday, February 10, 2012 from 4pm to 6pm in the Vernada Room of the Sofitel Hotel in Redwood City, California. Demo Friday is open to the public. This is an exciting and educational opportunity for everyone to get a hands on demonstration of what Linaro is enabling with Arm processor-based boards for Linux on Arm.

Previous demonstration events have included Kinnect-face robot recognizing human faces, Linaro Android Build Service, Automated Validation Infrastructure for Android system, Snowball board demo, Quick Start board demos and more.

Linaro Connect is held every three to four months to bring the Linux on Arm community together to learn about the latest SoC developments, plan the next development cycle and hack together. These events give the Linux community an opportunity to be a part of the Linaro team and help to define the Arm tools, Linux kernels and builds of key Linux distributions including Android and Ubuntu on member SoCs. Join us for our next event February 6-10th in San Francisco, CA. Learn more at[ https://connect.linaro.org](https://connect.linaro.org/)
