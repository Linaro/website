“Excellence is the Result of Caring more than others think is Wise, Risking
more than others think is Safe, Dreaming more than others think is
Practical, and Expecting more than others think is Possible.”
~ Ronnie Oldham

We are pleased to announce the release of Linaro 12.03.

Linaro 12.03 contains components delivered by all Linaro Teams –Working
Groups, Landing Teams and Platform Teams– and brings an abundance of
exciting updates and new features which are integrated on top of Android
and Ubuntu.  We, together with our members, partners and community
continue to build future of Linux on ARM and the 12.03 release is one more
step toward that future.

During the 12.03 release cycle, the Linaro Toolchain Working Group
announced the 12.03 release of both Linaro GCC 4.6 and Linaro GCC 4.5.
Linaro GCC 4.6 12.03 is the thirteenth release in the 4.6 series and is
based off the latest GCC 4.6.3 release; it contains a new scheduler
pressure pass, implements new instructions, and contains a number of bug
fixes. Linaro GCC 4.5 12.03 is the nineteenth release in the 4.5 series and
is based off the latest GCC 4.5.3+svn184976 release; this is a maintenance
only update. Additionally, the Linaro Toolchain Working Group announced the
release of Linaro QEMU 12.03 which is based off upstream (trunk) QEMU,
it includes a number of ARM-focused bug fixes and enhancements.

The Linaro Multimedia Working Group during the 12.03 Linaro release cycle
added updates to the following: pulseaudio and alsa, initial source code
only drop of TinyHal, libav AAC optimization and Speex for Android and
Linux.

The Graphics Working Group also announced its contributions to the 12.03
release adding updates and improvements to the following components:
glmark2, glcompbench, glproxy, nux and Unity.

Pre-built release images for the Android and Ubuntu LEBs are currenly
available with each of the Linaro monthly releases; however, new with the
Linaro 12.03 release is that now developers can get daily pre-builds of the
Ubuntu LEB which will be based on the current release of Ubuntu.  Pre-built
images can be found at snapshots.linaro.org.

"The introduction of prebuilt images for Linaro's daily output will widen the
reach of Linaro's integrated evaluation builds. One advantage to the
availability of these daily builds is that it gives professionals using Windows
and MacOSX the opportunity to more easily install these images using the
standard tools which are commonly available in these environments",  says
Alexander Sack, Technical Director, Linaro Platforms.

Linaro Member Services Program Director, Vicky  Janicki, says “Pre-built
images save time and effort for our Members and their customers as a
starting point for their work. Instead of hunting in different places for code,
images, and working out licensing agreements, an engineer simply goes to
the Linaro download site knowing all the pieces will work together. The
engineer now has access to a current Linux kernel in less than 10 minutes.”

Additional items of interest from the Linaro 12.03 release cycle include:

Registration is now open for the Linaro Connect Q2.12 event being held at
the Gold Coast Hotel in Hong Kong from 28 May through 1 June, and
brings together some of the best software developers from the Linaro
ecosystem to help develop and plan the future of Linux on ARM.

A 'Call for Submissions' for Linaro Connect Q2.12 Plenaries was also
announced --Do you have a great idea you would like to present to the
Linaro Connect Q2.12 attendees?   Want to share a Linaro success story
and motivate, inspire, excite or educate attendees? Then this is an
opportunity for you to get involved in this Linaro Connect event. More
information on how to submit your plenary talk ideas can be found in on the
wiki.

We encourage everybody to use the 12.03 release. The download links for all
images and components are available on our downloads page:

Using the Android-based images
=======================

The Android-based images come in three parts: system, userdata and boot.
These need to be combined to form a complete Android install. For an
explanation of how to do this please see:

[http://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/Android/ImageInstallation](http://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/Android/ImageInstallation)

If you are interested in getting the source and building these images

yourself please see the following pages:

[http://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/Android/GetSource](http://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/Android/GetSource)

[http://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/Android/BuildSource](http://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/Android/BuildSource)

Using the Ubuntu-based images
=======================

The Ubuntu-based images consist of two parts. The first part is a hardware
pack, which can be found under the hwpacks directory and contains hardware
specific packages (such as the kernel and bootloader). The second part is
the rootfs, which is combined with the hardware pack to create a complete
image. For more information on how to create an image please see:

[http://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/DevPlatform/Ubuntu/ImageInstallation](http://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/DevPlatform/Ubuntu/ImageInstallation)
