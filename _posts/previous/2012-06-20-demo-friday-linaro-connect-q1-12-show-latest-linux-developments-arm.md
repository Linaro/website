CAMBRIDGE, UK - 20 JAN 2012

## Linaro members, partners and community offer interactive demonstrations showcasing Arm-processor-based boards and Linaro builds of Android and Ubuntu

Linaro, a not-for-profit engineering organization consolidating and optimizing open source software for the Arm architecture, today announced Demo Friday, to be held at the Linaro Connect Q1.12 event. Demo Friday is a two-hour event that will showcase new and innovative ways Linaro members, partners and community are using Linaro Builds of Ubuntu and Android on Arm processor-based boards. Demo Friday will take place on Friday, February 10, 2012 from 4pm to 6pm in the Vernada Room of the Sofitel Hotel in Redwood City, California. Demo Friday is open to the public. This is an exciting and educational opportunity for everyone to get a hands on demonstration of what Linaro is enabling with Arm processor-based boards for Linux on Arm.

Previous demonstration events have included Kinnect-face robot recognizing human faces, Linaro Android Build Service, Automated Validation Infrastructure for Android system, Snowball board demo, Quick Start board demos and more. More about past events can be found on the Linaro wiki ([wiki-archive.linaro.org/Events/2011-05-LDS/Showcase](https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/Events/2011-05-LDS/Showcase)).

All companies and engineers who are using Linaro on Arm processor-based boards are invited to participate in Demo Friday and highlight their work. All the demonstrations for Demo Friday have not yet been finalized and there are opportunities to add more to the line-up. Anyone interested in this opportunity to participate can email the details of their demonstration to:[events@linaro.org](mailto:events@linaro.org).

## Join us for Linaro Connect Q1.12

Linaro Connect is held every three to four months to bring the Linux on Arm community together to learn about the latest SoC developments, plan the next development cycle and hack together. These events give the Linux community an opportunity to be a part of the Linaro team and help to define the Arm tools, Linux kernels and builds of key Linux distributions including Android and Ubuntu on member SoCs. Join us for our next event February 6-10th in San Francisco, CA.

About Linaro
Linaro is a not-for-profit engineering organization working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the Arm architecture, including the gcc toolchain, the Linux kernel, Arm power management, graphics and multimedia interfaces. Linaro's key value is in working on generic Arm technology that is common to all Arm SoC vendors. In this way engineering costs are shared, rather than each vendor having to implement core software technology themselves, which has resulted in fragmentation and overhead in maintaining code that cannot be upstreamed to the mainline Linux kernel and other open source projects. Linaro's output is used by its members, and by distributions including Android, Ubuntu and OEM/ODM customized versions of Linux. Linaro's goals are to deliver value to its members through enabling their engineering teams to focus on differentiation and product delivery, and to reduce time to market for OEM/ODMs delivering open source based products using Arm technology.
