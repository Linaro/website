Cambridge, UK; 27 July 2015

Linaro Ltd, the collaborative engineering organization developing open source software for the Arm® architecture, today announced that Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc. (QuIC), a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated, has become a Core Member of Linaro.

QuIC joined Linaro as a Club Member in February 2014 and actively participates in the Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG), the Linaro Mobile Group (LMG) and the Linaro Community Boards Group (LCG). QuIC joins Arm Ltd and HiSilicon, the SoC subsidiary of Huawei, as the third Core Member of Linaro. Core Members provide significant resources to Linaro, and participate across Linaro’s activities ranging from core open source software to specific projects from the mobile and embedded sectors to networking and enterprise products.

QuIC has brought a history of innovation in wireless technology into Linaro, as well as adds its extensive open source experience to the 200+ open source software engineers already working in Linaro helping to accelerate the delivery of open source software across the industry.

“We are delighted that QuIC is further developing its relationship with Linaro as a Core member”, said George Grey, Linaro CEO. “QuIC has a long history of supporting the open source community and has become a very influential member of Linaro through its commitment to open source, technical excellence and experience.”

Jason Bremner, senior vice president product management for Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. said, “QuIC has been committed to working with Linaro and other open source communities to accelerate the development of technologies on the Arm platform. After working for the past year with Linaro, we saw the advantages of becoming a Core Member and improving our ability to both further collaborate and benefit from the work that Linaro is doing.”

**About Linaro**

Linaro is leading collaboration on open source development in the Arm ecosystem. The company is a collaborative engineering organization with over 200 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the Arm architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, Arm power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro’s growing membership, and by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top five company contributors to Linux kernels since 3.10.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro’s engineering work is open to all online. To find out more, please visit [](<>) and [http://www.96Boards.org](https://www.96boards.org/).
