[Linaro](/about/) divides its Roadmap into four yearly quarters punctuated by our [Connect events](https://connect.linaro.org/), and this year our third quarter will be kicked off with a twist: instead of doing it physically at one location, we'll instead be running a week of online discussions. **Virtual Connect Q3.12** will run from** August 13th to 17th**, is open to the public, and will be entirely hosted on [Google+ Hangouts on Air.](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/google-hangouts-on-air-broadcast-your.html)

## What's a Virtual Connect?

Linaro Connects are events mainly made up of [BoF-style discussions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)), where a lead directs conversation, but every member in the audience can directly participate. In Virtual Connect we will use Google+ Hangouts on Air to accomplish a similar model: up to 10 participants can directly engage in videoconference, and an unlimited number can watch the live discussion that will be streaming via YouTube or the Google + profile. Participants who want to ask questions and give input to the discussion can do so using IRC (Freenode channel #linaro-connect).


## Software Requirements

You must have an up-to-date browser which supports [Google's Talk Plugin](http://www.google.com/talk/), and the plugin needs to be installed. Both Firefox and Chromium support Google+ Hangouts just fine. You also need a [Google Plus](http://plus.google.com/) account. A proper headset and microphone are strongly encouraged -- you may be muted by the session lead if your background noise is too loud. You are also encouraged to use a webcam if you are joining the Hangout on Air so that you can be part of the streaming video.

Make a point of testing your browser before the session; feel free to contact [Amber Graner](https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://plus.google.com/+LinaroOrg) or [Christian 'Kiko" Reis](https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://plus.google.com/+LinaroOrg) on [http://plus.google.com/](http://plus.google.com/) to run a test session at any time. If necessary contact any Linaro engineer on Freenode IRC channel #linaro for assistance in setting up your environment.

## Session Hours

Sessions run for 1.5 hours, with an additional 30 minutes of grace time being available if we happen to overrun. We will run three daily sessions on these times from Monday August 13th to Friday August 17th:

  * 10:00 UTC ([view local times](http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20120813T1000))


  * 15:00 UTC ([view local times](http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20120813T1500))


  * 21:00 UTC ([view local times](http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20120813T2100))


Session Leads will be online 15 minutes before the allotted time, so you're welcome to join early and wait for the fun to start.

## Tuning into Virtual Connect

To participate or watch a session, visit the [Linaro OnAir Google+ profile](https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://plus.google.com/116754366033915823792/posts). We'll open each session 15 minutes before the allotted time. When the session is open, you'll be presented with options to join or watch the Hangout, just like in this screenshot:

{% include image.html path="/assets/images/blog/hangout-1.png" alt="Screenshot of Linaro OnAir's Google Plus page hosting a Hangout" %}

Clicking on the play button will start video playback in the browser, while clicking on the "Join this hangout" button puts you in the conference itself. If you choose to join, you'll be placed directly into the session.  Please don't join the session after it starts and interrupt. The  session lead is noted in each session entry; notice the lead's cues as they direct the conversation towards the session agenda.

To help identify Hangout participants, we ask that you install the [Lower Third](https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://plus.google.com/+LinaroOrg) app by adding it to your Hangout view and configuring it, as in this screenshot:

{% include image.html path="/assets/images/blog/hangout-7.png" alt="Screenshot showing how to enable the Lower Third app in a Hangout" %}

We also ask you join the Freenode IRC channel #linaro-connect ([webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/) available) where you can post questions and add comments as you like.

## What If I Can't Make It?

All sessions will be broadcast live and recorded in the [Linaro OnAir Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVqQKxCyQLJS6xvSmfndLA?feature=mhee), where they can be viewed later.

And if you liked the experience, pen in the dates for the next, non-virtual, Linaro Connect, which will [be in Copenhagen](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/) during the week of October 29th, co-hosted with [UDS]()http://uds.ubuntu.com/. See you all there, and thanks!
