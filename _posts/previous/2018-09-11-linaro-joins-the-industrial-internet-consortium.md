Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm® ecosystem, today announced that it has joined the Industrial Internet Consortium® (IIC™), the world’s leading organization transforming business and society by accelerating the adoption of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).

Many IIC members are participating in advanced testbeds across many different industries. Linaro is eager to share its expertise about IIoT, Fog and Edge software with IIC members as part of the consortium.

Linaro’s new Edge & Fog computing group (LEDGE) is being formed to bring together companies to collaboratively work on open source software engineering in this area and it is expected - as Linaro has demonstrated in other areas - that combining engineering talent from member companies will accelerate development in a way no single company can achieve on its own. Linaro will also contribute software architecture expertise into working groups such as trustworthiness and edge computing.

“Open source software for Edge and Fog computing is a growing area,” said Dr. Richard Soley, Executive Director, IIC. “The IIC is excited to welcome Linaro as a member and is looking forward to Linaro sharing its unique expertise about open source software.”

“Collaborating on open-source software and enabling standards for industrial networking, like TSN, are key ways our company is driving embedded processing innovation for industrial applications,” said Pekka Varis, catalog processors technologist at Texas Instruments. “As a member of IIC and a founding member of Linaro, we have seen how both industry standards and open-source software can enable engineers to develop solutions to new challenges in Industrial IoT more quickly.”

“Linaro, as a leader in collaborative open source engineering, perfectly complements the IIC approach,” said Francois Ozog, Director of the Linaro Edge & Fog Computing Group. “On one side, Linaro can leverage the experience IIC has developed in testbeds and assess requirements to develop missing software components or best practices in the most efficient manner; on the other side, Linaro can provide IIC members with valuable hardware and software experience to find innovative and optimal ways to find solutions to technological challenges.”

**About Linaro**
Linaro is leading collaboration on open source development in the Arm ecosystem. The company has over 300 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the Arm architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, Arm power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro’s growing membership, and by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top five company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online.
