Day 1 of Linaro Connect Q2.12 on 28 May 2012 has already had some interesting moments which started with a packed room for the opening plenary sessions to standing room only for the big.LITTLE session.

For the first time Linaro is using Google+ Hangouts on air to live stream the morning sessions and asking those who are remotely participating to be patient as they work out the kinks-- sound issues, session leads being camera aware and slide presentations.

If you are interested in seeing the sessions that were recorded on Day 1 you can click on the links below or you can go to Amber Graner's  [YouTube channel] and follow along there as well.
