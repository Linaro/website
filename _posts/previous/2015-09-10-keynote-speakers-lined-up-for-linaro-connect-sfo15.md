The five-day event, which has sold out the past two shows, is celebrating its fifth year and has become the event to attend if you are interested in Linux development and related Arm-based ecosystems.  The agenda includes seventeen unique break-out track topics for attendees. Tracks will cover topics such as Android, Graphics and Multimedia, Kernel Consolidation, Platform Development, Power Management, QA and Infrastructure, Security, Tools, Validation and LAVA, and training

Along with the regular track sessions, there will be additional opportunities for attendees to learn about Linaro’s work. Each day has been designated a focus area that will be highlighted that day. On Monday will be Community and Tuesday will be Linaro Home Group and Linaro Mobile Group day. The Linaro Enterprise Group will host an Arm Server Ecosystem day on Wednesday that will connect Linux/Linaro developers with other project developers and will be an opportunity to see the latest 64-bit Arm hardware and software development in this space.  The Linaro Networking Group is also planning a special demo session at the end of its focused sessions on Thursday. Finally on Friday Linaro will host its traditional Demo Friday. The demos will also feature in some of the keynotes and at other times during the week, but participants will get to see most of them all together at Demo Friday. This is a great opportunity for attendees to see all the work that Linaro and its members have been focused on.
