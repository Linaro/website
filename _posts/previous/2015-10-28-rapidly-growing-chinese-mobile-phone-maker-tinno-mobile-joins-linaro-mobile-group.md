Cambridge, UK; 28 October 2015

Linaro Ltd, the collaborative engineering organization developing open source software for the Arm® architecture, today announced that Shenzhen Tinno Mobile Technology Company Ltd has joined the Linaro Mobile Group (LMG).

“Tinno Mobile is often referred to as the ‘hidden strong player’ behind leading French mobile phone brand Wiko, but the company is much more than that”, said Jill Guo, EVP, Linaro Greater China Region. “We’re very pleased to welcome Tinno to LMG and look forward to working with them and the other LMG members to develop shared mobile platform software for the latest Arm architecture on which they can further build their technological leadership.”

LMG was formed in July 2014 to consolidate and optimize open source software for Arm powered mobile phones, tablets, laptops and wearables. The Group's engineers work on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), Performance and Power optimizations, Graphics and GPGPU, and work closely with other groups in Linaro Core Engineering on other open source technologies. Tinno Mobile brings additional representation of the needs of today's mobile phone manufacturers to LMG and this will help the group and its silicon and software vendor members to work on projects that will accelerate the market.

“Tinno Mobile is proud of its technological leadership in areas such as dual-SIM mobile phones”, said Wang Bin, CTO of Tinno Mobile. “We’re very pleased to join Linaro to work with other leading mobile players on core platform software that will enable us to fully leverage and contribute to the long-term development of open source software.”

**About Linaro**
Linaro is leading collaboration on open source development in the Arm ecosystem. The company has over 250 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the Arm architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, Arm power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro’s growing membership, and by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top five company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online. To find out more, please visit [](<>) and [http://www.96Boards.org](https://www.96boards.org/).
