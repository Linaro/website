title: An Easy Way to Update Android Kernel Related Files Without Getting the sdcard
  Out

Do you feel it's difficult or complicated to update kernel related files for a running Android device?

Do you feel that it's boring to get the sdcard out when you just want to update some kernel files when the Android device is somewhere else?

The Linaro Android team now has tools to help you update kernel related files for an Android device through the use of a few commands--mostly only one command.

Do you want to update the kernel related files with a new boot.tar.bz2? You can do so with the following command:

    ./update-android.sh out/target/product/pandaboard/boot.tar.bz2

Do you want to update only the board.dtb file? No problem, you can do:

    ./update-android.sh out/target/product/pandaboard/boot/board.dtb

Do you just want to update the loglevel in /init.rc to 8?  Use the following command:

    ./update-uInitrd.sh /tmp/init.rc

What do you think about the tools? Do you want to give these commands a try? If so, you can get these scripts by using the following command:

    git clone http://android.git.linaro.org/git-ro/platform/external/linaro-android-tools.git
