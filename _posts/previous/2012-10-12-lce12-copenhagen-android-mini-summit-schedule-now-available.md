_As plans for [LCE12 - Copenhagen](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/#welcome) are finalized we are pleased to announce [schedules](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/#schedule) for the various mini-summits which are being held in conjunction with this Linaro Connect event._

_Below is a look at the Android Mini-Summit which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, October 31, 2012 during LCE12 at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Denmark._


## What is a Mini-Summit?


A Mini-Summit are tracks which focus on a single strategic topic and take place on a single day.  In this case the Linaro Mini-Summits will take place on Tuesday with Armv8 (64-bit), Wednesday with Android, and Thursday with big.LITTLE.


## What is the Linaro Android Mini Summit?


The Linaro Android Mini-Summit will have two themes, optimization and unification. The optimization theme will lead off with a benchmarking discussion and critique. The existing benchmark results and the methodology used to produce those results will be presented and examined. Having established a benchmarking foundation we will discuss Dalvik and V8 optimization. The first theme will complete with a discussion about possible power optimizations. The second part of the summit will discuss unification. We will discuss unification from two sides. The first side will look at what is currently being unified and what may need to be unified in the core Linux kernel and power and graphics subsystems. The second side will look at unification from a product perspective. The discussions and input from the mini-summit will feed into 4 sessions on Optimization, Core Kernel and Power, Graphics and Embedded Android.


## Will there be plenary sessions for this event?
