CAMBRIDGE, UK - 19 JUN 2013

Linaro, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the Arm architecture, today announced its new [Android build portal ](/engineering/consumer/)and [Engineering Group pages](/engineering/core/).

The [Android build portal](/engineering/consumer/) is designed to make it easier to share news about the latest Android developments at Linaro. The site includes sections with access to key Android information, including the latest news, videos and blogs related to Linaro’s Android work. It also includes important links to setting up a build and deploying images onto the Linaro members’ platforms. The[Engineering Group page](/engineering/core/)s provide deep links into the activities of Linaro’s Engineering Groups.

Individuals who want to get started with Android builds from Linaro will find the latest releases for members’ hardware and community builds for other devices on the portal. This material can also be used to produce custom builds of Android or as a starting point for engineers who want to contribute to Linaro’s Android work.  In addition to the expanded listing of news and builds the new portal gives access to the daily IRC chats so that the community can easily be a part of the development as it is happening. This new portal is an important part of Linaro’s commitment to leading the development of Linux on Arm by communicating openly and making it easier to share information about Linaro’s Android builds with the community. [Visit the new Linaro Android build portal.](/engineering/consumer/)

Since Linaro was founded in June 2010, collaborative engineering work has been done in engineering groups focused on the[Kernel](/kernel-and-toolchain/), [Toolchain](/kernel-and-toolchain/), [Graphics](/engineering/), [Power Management ](/kernel-and-toolchain/)and Platform Engineering. More recently, new vertically-focused segment groups have been formed and Linaro now has two of these: the [Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG) ](/engineering/datacenter-and-cloud/)and [Linaro Networking Group (LNG)](/engineering/). The new Engineering Group pages provide a single point of access to all the web locations that each of groups use, including Linaro Wiki links to meeting minutes and white papers and IRC channels for daily discussion.

**Join us at Linaro Connect**

Linaro Connect is held every three to four months to bring the Linux on Arm community together to work on the latest system-on-chip (SoC) developments, plan new engineering efforts and hold engineering hacking sessions. These events give the Linux community an opportunity to be a part of the Linaro team and help to define the Arm tools, Linux kernels and builds of key Linux distributions including Android and Ubuntu on member SoCs. The next Linaro Connect will be July 8-12th in Dublin, Ireland. Learn more at [www.linaro.org/connect](https://connect.linaro.org)
