CAMBRIDGE, UK - 15 OCT 2013

[Linaro](/), the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the Arm architecture, today announced the keynote speakers for the upcoming Linaro Connect USA 2013 (LCU13) that will take place October 28th – November 1st in Santa Clara, California.  The conference will feature several keynote speakers that will speak on a range of topics from High End Telecom Networking to Transformative Technology in the Internet of Things (IoT), data center and mobile, new developments in Linux and the Open Compute Project.  Linaro’s Chief Executive Officer, George Grey, will welcome attendees to LCU13 and speak about the future for open source software across a full range of segments, from servers to the Internet of Things (IoT).

Keynote speakers scheduled for the Linaro Connect USA 2013 include:

- George Grey - Chief Executive Officer, Linaro

In addition to the above keynotes at LCU13, attendees are invited to join the Arm TechCon keynote by Arm CEO Simon Segars. The Linaro Connect week-long agenda also features sessions on Android, Graphics and Multimedia, Kernel Consolidation, Platform Development, Power Management, QA and Infrastructure, Tools, Validation and LAVA, and training.  Along with the regular track sessions, there will be an additional networking mini summit on Tuesday October 29th from 9.00am - 1.00pm.

Held at the Santa Clara Convention Center, LCU13 is the place to learn about the future of Linux on Arm.  Engineers returning to their companies after Linaro Connect take back the latest software developments around Arm and new ways of optimizing the latest Arm technology.  This Linaro Connect is co-located with [Arm TechCon](http://www.armtechcon.com/), which runs from Tuesday October 29th to Thursday October 31st. Separate registration is required to attend the sessions of both events, but co-location gives attendees of Linaro Connect a unique chance to see most of Arm’s hardware and software ecosystem in one place at the Expo.
