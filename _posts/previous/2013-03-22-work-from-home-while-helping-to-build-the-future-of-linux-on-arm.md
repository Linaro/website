### Engineering Manager - Automation & CI

The person taking this role will oversee Linaro’s Automation Infrastructure team. This is an exciting position requiring a self-starter who can manage a very flexible workload.

Once a milestone is in place the they must work with their engineers to make sure things come together for each monthly release that can be deployed and used by Linaro stakeholders. In addition to working with first line engineers, the lead must also interface with Linaro member companies, management, and community members to explain a clear message about Linaro’s automation offerings such LAVA and CI. The person must also be able to give technical assistance where needed. Linaro is global company, and at times the lead will be expected to participate in meetings outside the normal working hours of their time zone. Often times this position will require the lead to help out with technical work such as bug fixes, code reviews, or implementing a feature for a monthly milestone. This aspect of the job is quite exciting but requires a person who can still keep track of how each person on the team is doing.
