Earlier this week [I](/about/) had the opportunity to sit down with [Andrea Gallo](/about/) our Director of the [Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG)](/engineering/datacenter-and-cloud/) via a [Google+ Hangout on Air](http://www.youtube.com/user/LinaroOnAir) and discuss this newly formed and [announced](/news/industry-leaders-collaborate-to-accelerate-software-ecosystem-for-arm-servers-and-join-linaro/) Linaro Group in more detail.



In this interview, Andrea explains Arm both as [an architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_architecture) and [a company](http://www.arm.com/about/index.php), [Linaro](/), [LEG](/engineering/datacenter-and-cloud/) and why LEG is being formed now. He explains his role and responsibilities as the Director of LEG. But that's not all, he also highlights the benefits of membership, how the scope and priorities of LEG are defined and what the top priorities will be over the next 6 to 18 months.

Other topics Andrea and I discuss include how the work of the LEG group is coordinated within Linaro and how that work will make it into the greater Arm ecosystem, and various upstreams like the Linux kernel?

With aggressive goals such as delivering the initial software before the end of this year I ask Andrea what that initial deliverable will really include and what members can expect out of this initial software?

Andrea also looks to the future and outlines what attendees of the next Linaro Connect event—[LCA13-Hong Kong, to be held in early 2013](https://connect.linaro.org/lca13/)— can expect and if those attending can expect to see invites to a LEG mini-summit? I'll give you hint at this answer; he said yes, but you'll have to watch the video to get more details.
