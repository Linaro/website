DUBLIN, IRELAND - 8 JUL 2013

## Industry leaders are gathering in Dublin, Ireland this week to define the future of Linux on Arm at Linaro Connect

Linaro Connect Europe (LCE13) began today with an opening keynote by George Grey, CEO of Linaro, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the Arm® architecture. Over 300 engineers from Linaro, Linaro’s 25 member companies and more than 20 other companies have gathered together to discuss and develop the future of Linux on Arm at the eleventh Linaro Connect.

Grey explained how the explosion in digital data exchange and usage of a rapidly expanding array of different devices is placing new demands on both hardware and software development. These demands offer opportunities for many companies, but a significant amount of common development work is a ripe target for collaboration, which will enable accelerated innovation and increased differentiation, leading to improved consumer choice.

“Linaro Connect has grown at each event and I am happy to say this week again promises to be the biggest and most productive yet,” said Grey. “Linaro membership has grown significantly over the last year and we are now not only driving new Linux technology development for mobile devices, but also for servers and networking.”

Grey also introduced the first of a full lineup of external keynote speakers presenting during the week: Parallels CTO James Bottomley kicked off the keynotes following Grey on Monday 8 July, then Wannes De Smet from Sizing Servers will be sharing his review of the first enterprise-class Arm server on Tuesday, Red Hat's Leslie Hawthorn explains best practices for overcoming challenges to collaboration, and COO of the Open Compute Project, Cole Crawford, introduces the project on Wednesday, and finally Bob Monkman from Arm will talk about Software Defined Networking on Thursday 11 July. These keynotes are in addition to the regular working group and hacking sessions that discuss the latest challenges facing the ecosystem and propose, develop and test solutions. Jon “maddog” Hall is also joining Linaro Connect to talk about collaborative work on performance tuning of open source software to support new Armv8 64-bit chips.
