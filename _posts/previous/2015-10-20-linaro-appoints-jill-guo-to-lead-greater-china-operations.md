Cambridge, UK; October 20, 2015

Linaro Ltd,  the collaborative engineering organization developing open source software for the Arm® architecture, today announced that Jill Guo has been appointed as the Executive Vice President to head up the company’s growing Greater China operations.

Ms Guo reports directly to CEO George Grey and is a member of [Linaro’s Executive Management team](/about/team/). “Greater China’s role in the world as both a producer and consumer of technology continues to grow in importance,” said George Grey, Linaro CEO. “The appointment of Jill Guo to our Executive team clearly demonstrates our commitment to invest in the region and help local companies benefit from the advantages of collaborative engineering and open source software.”

Although none of Linaro’s six founding companies were based in Greater China, the region has contributed key engineers to Linaro since the beginning and membership in the region has grown rapidly over the last three years. Nine of Linaro’s thirty five members are now from Greater China, including Linaro Core member HiSilicon, and Club members Mediatek, Spreadtrum and ZTE. This growth is expected to continue and the Linaro Greater China organization has plans to expand accordingly to support this development in local membership.

“I’m excited to develop my relationship with Linaro from my previous role as a partner to now working for Linaro to help lead the company’s development in its most rapidly developing region,” said Jill Guo, Linaro EVP of Greater China. “There are many opportunities for Greater China to benefit from open source software. Cooperative engineering in Linaro on non-differentiating technology provides instant access to experienced open source engineers and Linaro is a unique entry point into these opportunities.”

Ms Guo came to her first Linaro Connect in Hong Kong in 2013 when she was the Strategic Planning Director in ZTE Corporation’s Mobile Division Product Development Department. Prior to Linaro, Jill worked for ZTE for over 15 years in a variety of roles covering product marketing management, industrial supply-chain and ecosystem partnership management, ODM and outsourcing management, and mobile handset business research.
