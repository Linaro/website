## Leading China fabless semiconductor company Spreadtrum Communications joins Linaro to influence development direction of open source software

CAMBRIDGE, UK – 29 OCTOBER 2014

Linaro Ltd, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the Arm® architecture, today announced that Spreadtrum Communications (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. has joined Linaro as a Club Member.

Spreadtrum has been at the forefront of bringing competitively priced mobile platforms based on Android operating systems to the market since 2012, and most recently has worked with customers on the launch of sub-US\$40 Firefox OS smartphones in India and other countries. The company offers mobile smartphone platforms based on Arm’s Cortex-A processors.

“We are very happy to join the Linaro community and to collaborate with other companies on driving software innovation in mobile platforms,” said Xiaomao Xiao, VP of Software Platform at Spreadtrum. “Spreadtrum has worked with open source software for many years and we can clearly see the advantage of taking an active role in the open source communities, working to accelerate development on a range of platforms.”

The addition of Spreadtrum to the Linaro community brings membership of the collaborative engineering organization to a total of thirty companies, including other SoC suppliers, software vendors, OEMs and end users. The diversity of the membership and the focus of discussions and development efforts on core, mobile, networking, home and server software engineering results in collaboration between expert participants from the world’s most innovative companies, driven by input from key end users in the relevant market segments.

“I welcome Spreadtrum to Linaro as a Club Member. Their experience in mobile chipset platforms will be a valuable contribution to our technical and strategic discussions,” said Joe Bates, EVP of Member Services at Linaro. “The China ecosystem is increasingly more active in defining the development direction for open source software on Arm processors and I’m very happy that Spreadtrum wants to play a leadership role in industry collaboration through Linaro.”
