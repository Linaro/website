#### **Arnd Bergmann presented session: Linux on the Arm architecture and beyond**

Linux supports a large number of CPU architectures, and variations within those, but new hardware is increasingly built around the same few Arm CPU cores.\
In this talk, Arnd describes how and why this has changed over time from the perspective of the Linux kernel, how the maintainers deal with the large variety of Arm based SoCs today and how this may continue in the future.
