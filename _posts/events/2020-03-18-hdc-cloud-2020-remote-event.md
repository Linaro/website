  HDC.Cloud is Huawei's annual flagship event for global developers in the ICT
  field.

  The event serves as a way to build a global platform for exchanging ideas and
  trying out new things. We want to share the ICT technologies and capabilities
  Huawei has developed over the past 30 years. Our Kunpeng and Ascend
  processors, in particular, will be powerful new engines for global developers.

  We look forward to working with you to usher in a new era of computing.
  Together, let's dream big and fly high!
