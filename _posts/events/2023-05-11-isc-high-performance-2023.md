The 5th Arm HPC Users Group (AHUG) workshop at ISC is the annual gathering of end-users, developers, system operators, and technology providers involved in the growing Arm for HPC ecosystem. The workshop is supported by the Arm HPC User Group association and it is meant to deliver an event where attendees will gain insight about the latest news and updates regarding Arm in HPC. The event covers a full-stack approach promoting discussions around upcoming silicon and hardware platforms, site updates from government and academic labs operating Arm-based test-beds and production deployments, lessons learnt and effective strategies for applications porting and tuning, and implementations of the Arm ecosystem for cloud-based HPC. Relevant content for this workshop includes traditional HPC applications, edge applications with tie-ins to HPC, machine learning and acceleration of AI with newer Arm designs, emerging application areas such as bioinformatics and analytics, co-design and simulation techniques, and several other related topics. The workshop program will focus on invited presentations and open community submissions to ensure a diversity of talks that cross the many relevant areas of Arm HPC research, development, and deployment. A special lightning talks session will solicit dissemination of research undertaken by student and early career researchers.
