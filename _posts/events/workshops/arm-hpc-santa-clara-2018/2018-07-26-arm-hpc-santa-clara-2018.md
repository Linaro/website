**Arm Architecture HPC Workshop** __by Linaro and HiSilicon  on 26th July 2018__ – At the Huawei campus in [Santa Clara, CA](https://maps.google.com/?q=2330+Central+Expressway,+Santa+Clara,+CA+95050&entry=gmail&source=g).

**Logistics**: The workshop will be held at **Cafeteria Conference Room** in **Building C**. All outside visitors should head directly to the Linaro registration area which will be signposted. No need to go through Building B to sign in.

**About**: How does the Arm-Powered supercomputing future look and how can you prepare for it? The Arm Architecture HPC Workshop will bring together the leading Arm vendors, end users and the open source development community in the Bay area, to discuss the latest products, developments and open source software support. Topics of focus are, but not limited to:

*   Compilers including GCC, LLVM, C++, Fortran, optimisations, benchmarking and general support
*   OS and Runtime
*   Tools
*   Math Libraries
*   Orchestration
*   Machine Learning

**For End Users**: In the Arm Architecture HPC Workshop you will hear from Arm Members and their Partners, information about new trends, technologies and products for the planning and operation of an Arm-Powered supercomputer.

**For Arm Members and Partners**: The Arm Architecture HPC Workshop is a one day conference to provide training and discussion panels for Arm-Powered solutions and offerings for all aspects of HPC including Server, Networking, Storage and Development.

**You can expect**:

*   Exciting best practices and technology outlooks with peers from the Arm ecosystem
*   Unique opportunities to network with current Arm users, vendors and the developer community
*   We are looking forward to your visit!

**Arm Architecture HPC Workshop**

*   Cost (Free)
*   Sponsorship options available

        In order to test OpenHPC packages and components and to use it as a platform to benchmark HPC applications, Linaro is developing an automated deployment strategy, using Ansible, Mr-Provisioner and Jenkins, to install the OS, OpenHPC and prepare the environment on varied architectures (Arm, x86). This work is meant to replace the existing ageing Bash-based recipes upstream while still keeping the documents intact. Our aim is to make it easier to vary hardware configuration, allow for different provisioning techniques and mix internal infrastructure logic to different labs, while still using the same recipes. We hope this will help more people use OpenHPC with a better out-of-the-box experience and with more robust results

      <p>
          ARM's SVE instructions provide a whole new set of features for HPC computing. Engineers are understandably keen to start making sure their software is ready to take advantage as soon as hardware arrives. Up until now that has meant building and running in slow system emulation models. Fortunately the latest QEMU now supports SVE instruction in it's Linux user-emulation mode. Alex will talk through how to set this up so building and testing your SVE enabled code is as easy as running make.

Alex started learning to program in the 80s in an era of classic home computers that allowed you to get down and dirty at the system level. After graduating with a degree in Chemistry he's worked on a variety of projects including Fruit Machines, Line Cards, CCTV recorders and point-to-multipoint wireless microwave systems. Since the turn of the century his primary focus has been working with FLOSS platforms, especially Linux. An alumni of Transitive he has a broad experience of cross-platform virtualization as well as a strong background in telecommunications and networking.

      <h3>Vanguard Astra - Petascale Arm Platform for U.S. DOE/ASC Supercomputing</h3>
      <p>
          The Vanguard program looks to expand the potential technology choices for leadership-class High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms, not only for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) but for the Department of Energy (DOE) and wider HPC community. Specifically, there is a need to expand the supercomputing ecosystem by investing and developing emerging, yet-to-be-proven technologies and address both hardware and software challenges together, as well as to prove-out the viability of such novel platforms for  production HPC workloads.
       </p>
       <p>
           The first deployment of the Vanguard program will be Astra, a prototype Petascale Arm supercomputer to be sited at Sandia National Laboratories during 2018. This talk will focus on the arthictecural details of Astra and the significant investments being made towards the maturing the Arm software ecosystem.  Furthermore, we will share initial performance results based on our pre-general availability testbed system and outline several planned research activities for the machine."

      <h3>Isambard: the world's first production Arm-based supercomputer</h3>
      <p>
      The Isambard supercomputer is due to be the world's first production, Arm-based system when it goes online in the summer of 2018. The project, run by the GW4 alliance and the UK's Met Office, has already produced significant results using early access systems based on Cavium ThunderX2 CPUs. The production Isambard system will be a Cray XC50, complete with Cray's software toolchain ported to Arm. Isambard's early results compare the two most common open-source compilers - GNU and LLVM - with Cray's compiler. Early results suggest that Cavium ThunderX2 CPUs are performance competitive with the latest x86 CPUs, while delivering compelling performance per dollar advantages. Our experience has also been that porting complex production codes of millions of lines of legacy code is relatively painless, a significant achievement for the Arm software ecosystem. However, there are still some areas where improvement is required, and we shall highlight those in this talk.

      <h3>Intelligent Interconnect Architecture to Enable Next Generation HPC</h3>
      <p>
      The latest revolution in HPC interconnect architecture is the development of In-Network Computing, a technology that  enables handling and accelerating application workloads at the network level. By placing data-related algorithms on an intelligent network, we can overcome the new performance bottlenecks and improve the data center and applications performance. The combination of In-Network Computing and Arm based processors offer a rich set of capabilities and opportunities to build the next generation of HPC platforms.

      <h3>HPC network stack on Arm</h3>
      <p>
      Applications, programming languages, and libraries that leverage sophisticated network hardware capabilities have a natural advantage when used in today¹s and tomorrow's high-performance and data center computer environments. Modern RDMA based network interconnects provides incredibly rich functionality (RDMA, Atomics, OS-bypass, etc.) that enable low-latency and high-bandwidth communication services. The functionality is supported by a variety of interconnect technologies such as InfiniBand, RoCE, iWARP, Intel OPA, Cray¹s Aries/Gemini, and others. Over the last decade, the HPC community has developed variety user/kernel level protocols and libraries that enable a variety of high-performance applications over RDMA interconnects including MPI, SHMEM, UPC, etc. With the emerging availability HPC solutions based on Arm CPU architecture it is important to understand how Arm integrates with the RDMA hardware and HPC network software stack. In this talk, we will overview Arm architecture and system software stack, including MPI runtimes, OpenSHMEM, and OpenUCX.
