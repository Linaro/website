  Linaro Connect is an event that runs twice a year that brings together the Arm
  Ecosystem.

  This is the ONLY event where developers, maintainers of both hardware and software can collaborate on and discuss common problems.


  Due to the current climate we are running these events virtually. The next Linaro Connect will be held virtually March 23-25, 2021.
