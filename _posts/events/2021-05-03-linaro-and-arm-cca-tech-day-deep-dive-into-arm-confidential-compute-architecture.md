  Linaro and Arm are hosting a half-day online event to introduce the Arm Confidential Compute Architecture to developers in the open source community. This will be the first opportunity for developers to familiarize themselves with the hardware and software architectures and the resources available to enable OSS software development and upstreaming to progress.


  The agenda will include sessions on the Realm Management Extension as well as software and attestation architectures. Speakers will be presenting live and there will be opportunities for participants to ask questions. The full agenda will be posted on May 25. Registration is free and will open on May 25.
