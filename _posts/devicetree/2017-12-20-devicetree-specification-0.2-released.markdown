Today, version 0.2 of the Devicetree Specification was released.
Version 0.2 is a minor update, but it sets up the process by which
the Devicetree specification shall be developed from here on.

For 0.1, the document text was converted to Sphinx reStructuredText hosted
in a GitHub repository, but the output documents were still created manually.
Now for v0.2 and onwards the repo is integrated with
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com) and [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org)
to automatically and reliably build the output documents whenever new
changes are added to the master repo.

We're also accepting contributions.
Anyone is welcome to contribute by posting patches to the
 devicetree-spec@vger.kernel.org mailing list, or by raising issues on the
[GitHub page](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/issues).

You can download a copy of the v0.2 document here:
