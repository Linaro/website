SANTA CLARA, US - 29 OCT 2013

## Industry leaders in the Linaro Networking Group (LNG) are collaborating to develop and host an open standard application programming interface (API) for data plane applications on www.opendataplane.org


Linaro, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, today announced the launch of OpenDataPlane (ODP) and associated website [www.opendataplane.org](http://www.opendataplane.org/).

The ODP deliverable will be a data plane application programming environment designed to enable software portability between networking SoCs, regardless of the underlying instruction set architecture (ISA). The 12 Linaro Networking Group (LNG) member companies represent a cross section of networking original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), system on chip (SoC) companies and independent software vendors (ISVs), collectively having stakes in common data plane programming models for all the leading networking processor architectures.

“ODP is a good example of what the Linaro vertical segment groups are designed to achieve,” said George Grey, CEO of Linaro. “A group of industry stakeholders identify a strong demand for a common software model optimized across multiple hardware platforms. They then combine efforts to minimize redundant engineering effort and fragmentation, and accelerate an open source solution offering the flexibility, performance, scalability, interoperability and reliability that the industry requires.”

The ODP environment will consist of a common application programming interface (API) software layer, configuration files, services and utilities. It will support multiple underlying implementations, ranging from pure software to those embracing and extending existing vendor-specific software development kits (SDKs) highly-optimised for the underlying hardware. This follows standards such as OpenCL and OpenGL that just define the user level API and not the implementation. Networking applications will be written directly on top of the ODP environment to provide platform interoperability.

The data explosion in communication networks is driving the need for innovation and collaboration among industry stakeholders. Many new industry initiatives such as network function virtualization (NFV) have emerged, but much of this work is concentrated at the management, orchestration, services and control layers of the network. Since these layers will overlay onto the optimized data plane or forwarding plane hardware from different vendors, each with their own legacy SDK tuned to their individual platform, it is essential to develop a common interface across different SoC designs and silicon architectures. ODP will provide this with the first truly open source, cross platform solution designed and developed by a significant cross section of networking leaders, all of whom are members of the Linaro Networking Group.

The ODP standard will be developed in the open. The project API will adopt a BSD 3-Clause license so that companies can produce derivative applications based on ODP, without compromising their unique intellectual property. Furthermore this will allow vendors to support ODP across multiple architectures. Such support is already planned by multiple software companies and vendors. Once published, the project maintainers will seek feedback and contributions from the broad community to evolve and refine the software to meet the widest possible industry needs.
