Members of the Linaro Automated Validation Architecture [(LAVA) team](/about/) will be hosting a workshop that will include 4 hours of training.  This training will include an introduction, a hands on hacking session and a Q&A discussion session.

[The introduction sessions](https://lca-13.zerista.com/event/member/72489) begin with  [Dave Pigott, LAVA Lab Lead](/about/) giving  a high level introduction about LAVA, including a historical overview as well as insight into the current state of development and plans. Followed by [Tyler Baker, Linaro Technical Architect-Automation and CI engineer](/about/), who will give a 15 minute success story about an Android OEM that chose LAVA as a central piece of their sophisticated CI and validation solution.

[The 2 hour Hands-on LAVA session](https://lca-13.zerista.com/event/member/72677) is the core piece of the LAVA workshop. During the first hour of this session, LAVA software engineers, [Antonio Terceiro](/about/) and [Senthil Kumaran](/about/) will guide participants through the installation process of a complete LAVA system on their laptop. Antonio and Senthil will use the second hour of this session focused on teaching participants how to use lava-tes.

[The Q&A Wrap up session](https://lca-13.zerista.com/event/member/72377) will be a full hour dedicated to open discussion and Q&A. [Kate Stewart, Director of Product Management](/about/) and [Alexander Sack, Director of Platform](/about/) will act as moderators to our LAVA experts and participants during this session of the workshop.  To make this session as productive as possible, we plan to collect questions before and during the workshop, in addition to answering those raised during this wrap up session. In case you can’t attend this session, rest assured that we will write a FAQ capturing the questions and answers discussed and make it available after LCA-13.
