Karim Yaghmour, CEO, [Opersys Inc](http://www.opersys.com/)., will be leading a 4-part Embedded Android Training Workshop during the upcoming [Linaro Connect Asia (LCA-13)](http://connect.linaro.org) in Hong Hong.

## Embedded Android Training Workshop

While Android has been created for mobile devices -- phones first and now tablets -- it can, nonetheless, be used as the basis of any touch-screen system and due to Karim's headless Android work, non-touch embedded systems, whether it be mobile or not. Essentially, Android is a custom-built embedded Linux distribution with a very elaborate and rich set of user-space abstractions, APIs, services and virtual machine. This four-part workshop is aimed at embedded developers wanting to build touch-based embedded systems using Android. It will cover Android from the ground up, enabling developers to get a firm hold on the components that make up Android and how they need to be adapted to an embedded system.

Specifically, we will start by introducing Android's overall architecture and then proceed to peel Android's layer one-by-one. First, we will cover the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), the open source project under which Android's source code is released. We will then dig into the native Android user-space, Android's power tools, and cover how hardware support is implemented in Android. Given that Android is built on top of Linux, we will also go over some embedded Linux tricks and see how the kernel is modified to support the Android user-space. In addition, we will look at the System Server, the Android Framework and core Android applications, and how to customize them.
