Linaro Connect Europe 2013 ([LCE13-Dublin](http://connect.linaro.org)) will take place at the Burlington Hotel in Dublin, Ireland on 8 - 12 July.  Registration for this event is [now open](http://linaroconnect-lce13-eorg.eventbrite.com/).


## What is Linaro Connect all about?


Linaro Connect is all about engineering and building the future of Linux on ARM.  Each day starts out with exciting and informational keynotes, followed by a morning of sessions where the focus is on face-to-face collaboration that is meant to progress the engineering efforts around Linux on ARM.  These sessions are split into tracks which include kernel, power management, toolchain, graphics and multimedia, platform, validation, and QA tracks. In addition to these tracks there are also various training workshops and mini-summits throughout the week.

Engineers and other participants who attend LCE13-Dublin can expect to return to their companies with the latest Linux developments around ARM, new ways of optimizing ARM technology, an improved upstreaming support network and a strong desire to return.

While we do offer remote participation for most sessions through Google+ Hangouts On Air, nothing beats the opportunities that come from face-to-face interaction in sessions and "hallway" tracks. It is this face-to-face interaction with leading open source maintainers and engineers that is a **key benefit** for all those who participate in person at the event.
