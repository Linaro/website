Demo Friday will take place on Friday 12 July at the Burlington Hotel in Dublin, Ireland, as part of [Linaro Connect Europe 2013 (LCE13](http://connect.linaro.org)).

Are you currently using a [Linaro build, toolchain, or code](/downloads/) and want to show off your work?

Then Demo Friday is the place for you. We want to see how you are pairing Linaro's engineering output and ARM processor-based hardware solutions.

If you or someone you know is interested in the opportunity to demonstrate how you are using Linaro, please email the details of your demonstration to: [connect@linaro.org](mailto:connect@linaro.org)

In your email please include the following:


  * Name

  * Company

  * Description of demonstration (The demonstration must be Linaro related, and those presenting the demonstration should be able to tell attendees how Linaro is making their product or demonstration better)

  * Any equipment requirements

  * Participants must be available to set up their demonstration prior to the start of the event and immediately after event ends.

Please create a poster that lets attendees know all about your demonstration. The template for creating the demonstration poster is available [here](/assets/downloads/Demo-Friday-Demo-Poster-Template_LCE13_Dublin.odp). All posters must be returned to Linaro by **Friday June 7** in order to guarantee printing for Demo Friday event. Poster Size when printed will be A2 (11.7x16.5 inches).
