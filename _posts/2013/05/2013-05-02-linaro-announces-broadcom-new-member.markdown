CAMBRIDGE, UK - 2 MAY 2013

Linaro, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, today announced Broadcom Corporation has joined Linaro as a club member.

Broadcom, a global innovation leader in semiconductor solutions for wired and wireless communications, will contribute engineering resources to collaborate directly with Linaro and will participate in the organization’s steering committees directing the activities of Linaro’s engineering team.

“We’ve been very impressed by the Broadcom engineers who have actively participated in our Linaro Connect events and in the establishment of the Linaro Networking Group (LNG),” said George Grey, CEO of Linaro. “Linaro is very pleased to welcome Broadcom as a member. We value Broadcom’s communications expertise and we look forward to delivering a high ROI, leveraging their input and contributions as part of the combined work of our engineering teams.”

“We look forward to working with Linaro and the open source community to drive the Linux-on-ARM architecture,” said Ajith Mekkoth, Broadcom Vice President, Software Engineering, Mobile Platform Solutions.  “Together with Linaro, we are committed to accelerating innovation in the development of Linux-based devices and furthering the adoption of open-source software across the network.”

Linaro has a unique business model where multiple companies jointly invest in a software engineering team that creates core open source software in a collaborative and transparent environment. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro’s growing membership, and by Linaro becoming one of the largest company contributors to recent Linux kernels*. Linaro’s contribution to improving ARM’s support in the open source Linux community has also been recognized by Linus Torvalds**.

Linaro is the place where engineers from the world’s leading technology companies define the future of Linux on ARM. The company is a not-for-profit engineering organization with over 150 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the ARM architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, ARM power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro’s engineering work is open to all online.
