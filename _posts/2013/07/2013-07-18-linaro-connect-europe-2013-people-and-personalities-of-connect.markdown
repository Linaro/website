Linaro Connect Europe 2013 (LCE13) in Dublin, Ireland was an amazing week long event complete will keynotes, planning sessions, afternoon hacking, social events, and more.

At each of these events, I take moment to pull some of the attendees away from their busy schedules and find out what they are working on, what they are excited about, what people can expect between events and more.

LCE13 was no exception. Working with FormsComm AV (our wonderful video team), I was able to find a moment for [David Rusling, Linaro CTO](/blog/its-all-maddogs-fault-proclaims-david-rusling-linaro-cto/) to interview one of my favorite people in open source, Jon Maddog Hall about the work he will be doing for the [Arm 64-bit porting project](http://youtu.be/W7fwu4t5Gtc).

Another highlight for me, was to speak with [Jon Masters](https://plus.google.com/106265217227408958782/posts) of [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/). Jon never ceases to surprise attendees at each event he attends. True to form, Jon introduced attendees to [Google Glass](http://www.google.com/glass/start/) and gave us a glimpse of what LCE13 is like through the lens of Google Glass.

Also from [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/), [Leslie Hawthorn](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCwQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhawthornlandings.org%2F&ei=vQLoUe7kH9Ww4AOimYDoBQ&usg=AFQjCNGR-S4V1kzg4BbKOHea-IQU_5WreQ&sig2=sGKCFVT0t9ChkMW5auaNyw&bvm=bv.49478099,d.dmg) who welcomed everyone on Wednesday morning with a keynote about why open collaboration is important. Leslie also gave pointers on how to achieve successful and effective open collaboration with a community.

[Larry Wikelius](http://silverlining-systems.com/) of [Calexda](http://silverlining-systems.com//) took a few moments out of his busy schedule to talk Arm 64-bit servers and what we can expect to see from Calexda over the next 6 months to a year.

[LAVA, LAVA, LAVA!](/engineering/core/) There were so many sessions, demo's and even a mini-summit related to testing and validation at LCE13 that I snagged two members of the LAVA team-[Alan Bennett](/about/) and [Tyler Baker](/about/)- to chat with me about why LAVA is so awesome and how it's making a difference for developers in the Linux on Arm space.

[Andrea Gallo](/about/), stopped by for a few moments to tell me all about some exciting sessions that were coming out of the [Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG)](/engineering/datacenter-and-cloud/). We talked about OpenJDK, ACPI and the [KVM on Arm demo](/news/linaro-launches-opendataplane-odp-project-deliver-open-source-cross-platform-interoperability-networking-platforms/) that took place during Demo Friday.

[George Grey](/about/team/executive/), Linaro CEO and [Rob Booth](/about/), Linaro COO both found some time to step in front of the cameras. George summarized the week as he discussed power management, 64-bit KVM, networking, LAVA and more. Rob explained Linaro as a Non-profit and what it means to be part of the Arm ecosystem and open source. Both George and Rob discussed the future of Linaro and what they were looking forward to seeing come out of LCE13 between now and [LCU13](https://connect.linaro.org/lcu13/) which will be co-located with Arm TechCon 2013 in Santa Clara, CA.

Last but not least, is [Cole Crawford](http://www.opencompute.org/news/cole-crawford-joins-the-foundation-as-coo/) of the [Open Compute Project (OCP)](http://www.opencompute.org/) stopped by as well. Cole was also one of our keynote speaker for LCE13. Cole took a moment to explain why he was excited about LAVA-LMP and why the relationship with Linaro was important. Cole also invited Linaro Connect to co-locate with OCPs summits and hinted at the collaboration efforts between Linaro and its community and the OCP community.
