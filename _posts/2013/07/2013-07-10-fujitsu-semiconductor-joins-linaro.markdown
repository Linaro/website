CAMBRIDGE, UK - 10 JUL 2013

Linaro, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM architecture, today announced that Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited has joined Linaro to cooperate on new ARM technologies.

Fujitsu Semiconductor will contribute resources to work together with the resources from existing Linaro members. This shared team of over 100 engineers is directed by a [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](/about/tsc/), which now includes Fujitsu Semiconductor.

Through the TSC, Linaro members are defining the future of Linux on ARM. Accelerated time to market for new ARM technologies is achieved by working together within Linaro on shared solutions, while focusing members' in-house engineering resources on differentiation.

Linaro uses a unique business model where multiple companies create core open source software once with a shared investment in a single software engineering team, rather than by creating multiple, fragmented software solutions in isolation. Membership delivers an immediate return on investment as new members get immediate access to a significant engineering team.

"We are pleased to join Linaro as a [Club Member](/members), and Linaro Linux Kernel which supports ARM big.LITTLE technology enables the development of powerful, yet low power consumption SoC for a broad range of embedded applications" said Mitsugu Naito, executive vice president, Advanced Products BU, Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited. "Our SoC development expertise coupled with Linaro Linux Kernel works on ARM big.LITTLE processing technology will provide the market with the combined performance and low power required for the next generation of innovative embedded products."

"We are very pleased to welcome Fujitsu Semiconductor as a Linaro member," said George Grey, Linaro CEO. "With Linaro continuing to enable shared member investment on consolidation and optimization of Linux and Android on ARM, as well as working on new ARM technologies such as big.LITTLE and next-generation 64-bit devices, we are excited to have Fujitsu Semiconductor working closely with us."

About Linaro

Linaro is the place where engineers from the world’s leading technology companies define the future of Linux on ARM. The company is a not-for-profit engineering organization with over 140 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the ARM architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, ARM power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro’s engineering work is open to all online. To find out more, please visit .
