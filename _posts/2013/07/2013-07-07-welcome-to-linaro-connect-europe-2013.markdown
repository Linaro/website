On Wednesday 10 July 2013, we will have a 'chill out' hacking session in the evening where Jon maddog Hall will give a presentation on [preparing GNU/Linux for the 64-bit ARM processors](https://lce-13.zerista.com/event/member/79645).  In an effort to port these modules to 64-bit architecture it was suggested that the Linux community might be willing to help.  A preliminary plan for engaging the GNU/Linux community has been created and Linaro would like to present this preliminary plan to some of its members, after which brainstorming and discussion will occur on how to best improve and implement the plan. Additional, [a more formal session on this topic on Friday](http://lce-13.zerista.com/event/member/79673).
