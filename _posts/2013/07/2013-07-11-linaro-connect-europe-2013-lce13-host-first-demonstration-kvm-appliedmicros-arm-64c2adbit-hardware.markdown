DUBLIN, IRELAND - 11 JUL 2013


## In summary

Following the public showing of its X­-GeneTM ARMv8 64­-bit Server on a Chip™ solution at the Red Hat Summit, AppliedMicro is now ready to demonstrate KVM running on the X-Gene platform

The Demo Friday event at Linaro Connect Europe (LCE13) on 12 July 2013 will play host to the world’s first demonstration of KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) running on an ARMv8 64-­bit silicon platform from Applied Micro Circuits Corporation (NASDAQ: AMCC).

“We are very proud of the ARM, Linaro and AppliedMicro software engineers who teamed up to develop and demonstrate KVM on AppliedMicro’s X-GeneTM Cloud Server™ system, bringing to reality enterprise-class virtualization on ARM 64-bit servers,” said Dr. Paramesh Gopi, President and CEO of AppliedMicro. “Enterprise and private cloud customers can now access a complete set of tools to enable low-TCO Platform-as-a-Service applications and to accelerate the seamless transition to ARMv8 64-bit hardware.”

The demonstration will show KVM ARMv8 64-­bit based virtualization on the AppliedMicro X-­C1 hardware platform featuring the company’s X-Gene Server on a ChipTM silicon solution. This solution consists of eight ARMv8 64-­bit processors running four SMP Linux guest VMs (two ARMv7 32­-bit and two ARMv8 64-­bit guests) with web servers running concurrently on each VM using VirtIO-based network virtualization. The web servers will be delivering HTML web pages with varying graphical content.

ARM handled porting KVM for this demonstration from 32-­bit to 64­-bit, while AppliedMicro engineers brought the KVM up on the hardware and Linaro ensured a robust solution.

“It’s very exciting to be working with AppliedMicro on the world’s first ARMv8 64­-bit hardware platform,” said George Grey, Linaro CEO. “We look forward to showcasing KVM virtualization running on this platform tomorrow during the Linaro Connect Demo Friday.”

This Linaro Connect in Dublin, Ireland is playing host to over 300 engineers working on open source software for the latest ARM processor technology. The attendees from Linaro’s 25 member companies have been joined by other key players in the ARM ecosystem to define the future of Linux on ARM. The event concludes on Friday, 12 July with Demo Friday ­- an opportunity for working groups, individual contributors and member companies like AppliedMicro to showcase their most recent developments.
