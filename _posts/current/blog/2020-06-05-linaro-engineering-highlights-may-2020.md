### **Linaro AI Project: uTVM**

By Tom Gall, Director, AI/ML Project Lead

TVM is an AI compiler for inferencing which can create highly optimized binaries for deploying on ARM systems. Micro TVM or uTVM is an effort to leverage the advanced technology in the compiler infrastructure as applied to microcontroller devices.

From the Members meeting in January you might remember the exercise to determine what activities would bring value to Linaro members involving AI on microcontrollers. The recommendation delivered to the LITE-SC was to approve a uTVM project as part of the AI efforts within Linaro. The LITE-SC vote is in progress as this is being written.

If any individual member would like a briefing we are happy to do so.

A product level specification, internal to Members and Linaro only, has been created which documents the various modifications / goals that need to be completed in order to evolve uTVM from its current PoC/Alpha state to a mature piece of software which can be utilized within Member products. The creation of this document is a group effort by those engaged in the project. The document will serve as our roadmap to success
