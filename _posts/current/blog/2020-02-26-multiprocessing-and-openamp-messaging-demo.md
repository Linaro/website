Linaro and its members are developing a set of software components and tools to help with a system approach to multiprocessing. This short video shows a multiprocessing demo running on the STM32MP1 from STMicroelectronics.

Featured Linaro work in this demo includes:

- Devicetree - an on-going area of work in Linaro
- OpenAMP - a Linaro Community Project
- 96Boards specification - Avenger96 Community Board and mezzanine expansion
- Zephyr - Linaro is a contributor to the Zephyr project

For more details of these technologies, please see our [previous blog on heterogeneous multicore systems](/blog/heterogeneous-multicore-systems-the-new-open-source-frontier/).
