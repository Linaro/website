Linaro has released the latest support for Debian and OpenEmbedded releases for the following Qualcomm Snapdragon based [96Boards devices](https://www.96boards.org/) : the [Dragonboard 410c](https://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/), the [Qualcomm Robotics platforms RB3](https://www.96boards.org/product/rb3-platform/) and the [Qualcomm Robotics platforms RB5](https://www.96boards.org/product/qualcomm-robotics-rb5/).

We are committed to keeping the Dragonboard platforms up to date with the latest Linux kernels and user space components for the Qualcomm boards. The Debian and OpenEmbedded releases are usually in sync, and offer different approaches to build a Linux system.  

The Debian releases for the Qualcomm Snapdragon based 96boards platforms include a major system upgrade to Debian Sid, a major kernel upgrade to Linux Kernel 5.13.9 and a MESA upgrade to v20.3.5. The OpenEmbedded releases include a system upgrade to Dunfell (3.1.10 LTS), a major kernel upgrade to Linux Kernel 5.13.9 and an SDK release based on Dunfell (3.1.10). Note that a firmware/bootloader upgrade might be required for this release. You must ensure you are using the most recent firmware version. Refer to [the release notes](https://www.linaro.org/downloads/#releases_for_snapdragon) for more details. 

This is the first Linaro release which provides Debian support for the RB5 platform. Debian reference images with the GNOME3 desktop environment are provided.

Access the above releases, documentation, and release notes from [the Linaro downloads page](https://www.linaro.org/downloads/), community support can be provided on [the 96boards forum](https://discuss.96boards.org/).
