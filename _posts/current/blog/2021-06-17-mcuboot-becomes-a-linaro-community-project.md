Today the [MCUboot Project joined the Linaro Community Projects Division](https://www.mcuboot.com/news/blog/mcuboot-project-joins-linaro-community-projects-division/), the division of Linaro managing open source community projects, including Trusted Firmware and OpenAMP. MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bit MCUs.

The MCUboot project aims to define a common infrastructure for the bootloader and system flash layout on microcontroller systems to ensure secure and easy software upgrades. Operating system and hardware independent, MCUboot currently works with Apache Mynewt, Zephyr, and Mbed OS operating systems, as well as with the Trusted Firmware-M secure environment. The project plans to support upcoming standards such as Software Updates for  IoT (SUIT), the recent NIST Cybersecurity for IoT Guidance drafts (NISTIR 8259D) and the FIDO Device Onboarding (DO) standard. The project also plans to continue support for new devices and new technologies in those devices.

The founding members of this project are Arm, Infineon, Linaro, Nordic Semiconductor and STMicroelectronics. To find out more about the project and how to join or participate, go to [www.mcuboot.com](https://www.mcuboot.com/).
