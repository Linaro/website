Earlier today, the OpenAMP Project joined the Linaro Community Projects Division, the division of Linaro managing open source community projects, including Trusted Firmware and devicetree. The OpenAMP project aims to standardize interactions between operating environments in a heterogenous embedded system through open source solutions.

It is a framework providing the software components needed to enable the development of software applications for asymmetric multi-processing (AMP) systems. This allows operating systems to interact within a broad range of complex homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures, as well as asymmetric multiprocessing applications to leverage parallelism offered by the multicore configuration.

Membership is open to both Linaro members and non-members. Current members includeÂ  Arm, Kalray, Linaro, Mentor, ST Microelectronics, Wind River and Xilinx.
