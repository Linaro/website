This blog series will describe our experiments in evaluating network latency with IEEE802.1 [TSN](https://1.ieee802.org/tsn/) (Time Sensitive Networking) technology, especially under virtual machine (hypervisor) environments.

The first article will explain our assumptions, test system setup and different configurations of virtual network interfaces that we are going to evaluate.

# B﻿ackground

Nowadays the Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) has been gaining momentum in the automotive industry. A modern vehicle has to deal with information from a number of sources. As well as data from the powertrain and chassis there are now increasingly Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The infotainment system has expanded from managing a radio and potentially a CD player to sourcing data from the outside world via the cloud. As such, more and more software components have been integrated in building and creating a modern vehicle.

Linaro's white paper on [“Software Defined Vehicles and the Need for Standardization”](https://static.linaro.org/assets/automotive_white_paper_0921.pdf) surveys this trend, summarises architectural transformation along with standardized technologies being deployed in this segment and illustrates challenges that we are facing now and in the near future.

In the traditional systems, fixed-function Electric Control Unit(ECU)s are connected directly to the sensors, relays and actuators, creating purpose-specific domains. Even today, as mentioned in Linaro's white paper, the number of ECUs in a premium car has increased significantly to 150 ECUs.

As this number of ECUs grows into the hundreds, there is a push to integrate multiple services onto a smaller number of ECU servers. The logical next step is to virtualise their functions onto more powerful centralised ECUs by taking advantage of hypervisor isolation.

The wiring harness has also been a big problem in terms of space and weight; According to [the article](https://semiengineering.com/shedding-pounds-in-automotive-electronics/), an average vehicle has 100-120 lbs of wire harness and a luxury car contains 1,500-2000 copper wires or over 1 mile in total length.

In the zonal architecture, electric devices including sensors/actuators will be connected to ECUs on the servers via zonal gateways. Networks between them will then be converged and replaced from traditional CANbus technology to standard ethernet which will bring in a single unified bus as system-wide networking, simplifying the complexity of network management and reducing a total cost of physical wiring.

# T﻿ime Sensitive Networking and Performance

As many of the automotive applications require some level of realtimeness, the default best effort approach in the ethernet protocol isn't suitable for reliable data exchanges over the network. Here we have a solution, Time Sensitive Networking (TSN).

TSN is a collection of standards defined by IEEE801.2 and seen as extensions to IEEE801.Q (VLAN), addressing issues like network latency and robustness. TSN provides the predictable nature of real-time communications where particular packets are expected to be delivered within a specific time with minimum jitters whereas other low-priority traffic are also allowed on a best-effort basis.

TSN includes several features like:

* clock synchronization (Precision Time Protocol, or in short PTP):
  all the clocks of the devices connected to the network, including NICs and routers, will be synchronized to behave based on shared time reference.
* various network schedulers/shapers:
  Credit-based scheduler (cbs or Qav) provides fair scheduling, allowing managed bandwidth for each traffic, while time-aware shaper (tas or Qbv) enforces deterministic delivery under strict packet gate controls. There are more schedulers and shapers defined in the standards.
* resource management protocol (SRP):
* multiple paths and frame replication:

With those technologies combined and properly configured, some level of determinism in packet delivery is guaranteed. This determinism is, however, limited at hardware or mac layer. As more software components, along with kernel or hypervisor interventions, get stacked both on sender side and receiver side, software plays dominant roles in increasing end-to-end latency in specific use cases.

Linaro has been getting involved in TSN related development works and contributed to bringing them into mainstream for broader user experiences. At Linaro Connect Bangkok 2019, we also presented our experiments ([XDP for TSN](https://resources.linaro.org/en/resource/F6xXMMdkS6BjHdqri8Yy76) and [XDP Offload for OPC UA](https://resources.linaro.org/en/resource/TG82UyhpmJafAmEfiaWXP4)) and demonstrated a fast data path utilizing the AF_XDP technology for minimizing the software overhead in the kernel network stack.

We are now going to [move forward](https://linaro.atlassian.net/browse/STR-68); the ultimate goal is to optimise some software overhead and strive to guarantee the worst-case latency under a virtual machine environment. As a first step, we will measure and evaluate network performance, especially latency, for different implementations of virtual network interfaces and then look into some of the potential factors that might impose non-negligible overheads in packet delivery.

# L﻿atency Evaluation

## S﻿imple Scenario

In a real-world car, there are plenty of different types of data transmitted between devices/gateways and ECU servers over the network. For instance, side or rear-view cameras should deliver view images in constant intervals to the center console (cluster). In powertrain and chassis control systems, more variety of data from sensors must be guaranteed to be transmitted over the ethernet with strict criteria and ECU application is also expected to be able to manage devices (like actuators) by sending control messages in a reliable manner. This type of traffic must be much more deterministic (with strict behaviors) than data streaming for infotainment and absolutely critical for the safety system.

While we will have to learn more about system criteria, in particular, network traffic characters and related requirements, we cannot at this stage simulate the whole system with realistic applications, instead we would like to consider a simple use case with two different types of network traffic in this study.

* latency-critical messages
  Those may mimic periodic data transmission from device as well as some control messages from ECU
* bulk data streams on a best-effort basis

Assuming the network configuration, including TSN, is properly set up and all the traffic is arbitrated at some manageable level, we can expect that this model will tell us enough fundamentals to understand basic behaviors of a system (OS and hypervisor) under mixed and congested network traffic load.

## V﻿irtual Network Interface

We use kvm as a hypervisor in this study since there are several choices available for virtual network configurations. One of the advantages of using kvm is that, as it is integrated in the Linux kernel, using built-in instrument tools makes it easier to examine and analyze behaviors around networking in the system later on.

a﻿) bridge in host

b﻿) macvtap

c﻿) offload to userspace (vhost-user)

In addition, we examine the PCI pass through for comparison purposes.

d﻿) PCI pass through (of physical device or SR-IOV virtual function)

We always use virtio-net as a virtual network device on guest VM side since it is a common hypervisor-agnostic interface and can perform much better than a user-mode device fully-emulated by qemu.

### b﻿ridge within host

A tap device is an in-kernel network interface which corresponds to a virtual network exposed to a guest VM. Adding a tap device and a physical device on the host OS to the same bridge allows a guest VM to communicate with devices and gateways participating in the external network.

We assume that vhost-net is on so that we can always save additional cost in virtqueue handling due to context switches and data copy.

We think of following bridge implementations:

a-1) kernel bridge:

This is a default configuration when a network device is set up with a tap interface.

a-2) Open vSwitch:
The kernel bridge in (a-1) case will be replaced with in-kernel openvswitch module. Since packets are handled per-interrupt base and vhost-net and virtio components still remain in the data path, unlike "userspace offload" case below, we see little improvement thanks to this simple replacement.

a-3) XDP-based bridge:
Two XDP programs are to be installed for ingress and egress paths. When a new packet arrives at a port, its destination is looked up in an internal table by XDP program. If it is destined to guest VM (in ingress case), it will be redirected to a corresponding tap interface as a fast data path. Other packets are passed on to the normal kernel network stack (in this case, kernel bridge) as a slow data path.

### macvtap

Macvtap is a combination of macvlan and tap interface. Each macvtap interface has its own mac address on an associated physical network interface and all the packets destined to this address are directly redirected to a guest VM at the low layer of kernel network stack.

### Userspace offload

This is an advanced configuration to skip most of the kernel software stack on the host OS. A userspace application may fetch all the packets directly from a network device driver and re-routes them to guest VMs via vhost-user in userspace.

Open vSwitch is one such technology and can utilize either DPDK (Data Path Development Kit) or AF_XDP socket to bypass kernel overhead. AF_XDP support seems to be experimental as of now, though.

### PCI pass through

Some NICs have virtual functions of network interfaces (SR-IOV), which are directly exposed to guest VMs with assistance from VFIO framework and work as isolated network devices on VMs. As we skip most of the overhead imposed by the host or hypervisor, we can expect the optimal performance in a virtual machine environment.
This solution, however, comes with limitations. First, available virtual functions are subject to the hardware. Second, managing packets going out of different virtual machines is complicated and the traffic may not be well arbitrated to satisfy latency requirements.
