The Linaro Forge team is thrilled to announce our continued sponsorship and participation at the Rice University Energy HPC Conference in Houston. For more than a decade, we have been a proud supporter of this paramount event, which stands as the global summit for technical and business leaders in the energy sector. This conference serves as a vital platform for sharing insights, presenting technical findings, and contemplating the future landscape of the energy industry. Linaroâ€™s commitment to this gathering reflects the dedication of the Linaro Forge team to the energy sector and our role in its ongoing evolution.


Since our inception, Linaro Forge has been at the forefront of providing high-performance computing (HPC) debugging and performance engineering tools. Our solutions have become indispensable for organizations developing codes for a variety of applications, from reverse time migration to large-scale reservoir simulation. These tools have not only facilitated traditional energy exploration and production but have also adapted to the industry's expansion into renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal development.


The shift towards renewable energy has necessitated a broader spectrum of applications to enable sustainable energy development. The Linaro Forge team has eagerly embraced this transition, working closely with our customers to adopt innovative methods. Our collaborations have ranged from supporting large-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for wind energy production to advancing load modeling for solar development. These efforts underscore our commitment to innovation and our contribution to the energy sector's sustainability and efficiency.


As the energy landscape continues to evolve, so do we. The Energy HPC Conference provides an excellent opportunity for us to connect with industry leaders, share our latest advancements, and discuss our vision for the future. We are particularly excited about showcasing our roadmap for upcoming releases and exploring how our tools can further empower the energy sector.


We invite you to join us, visit our booth to catch up on the latest developments in Linaro Forge and learn more about how our solutions are driving progress in the energy industry. Whether you're a longtime partner or new to the field, we look forward to discussing how we can support your endeavors in this dynamic and critical sector.


See you in Houston, where innovation meets energy!
