Linaro will be exhibiting at ELC-E in Lyon next week, showing engineering solutions
for the Arm Ecosystem and how we work with members to consolidate codebases in the ecosystem as a whole and in specific market segments.

**On the Linaro stand we’ll be talking about:**

- the ecosystem and community projects that we host and/or contribute to - including Linux, toolchains, boot and security
- LAVA, our continuous integration system for deploying operating systems on to physical and virtual hardware for running tests; designed for validation during development
- Leveraging Linaro’s expertise on a custom project through Linaro Developer Services - how Linaro can help your company build, deploy, secure and maintain your code, including CI and automated validation

**Our demonstrations:**

- The Linaro open source hardware and software ecosystem around the STMicroelectronics STM32MP1
- LAVA which powers the Linux Kernel Functional Test (LKFT) project
