Earlier today, Trusted Firmware - the project hosted by Linaro Community Projects Division - announced that Renesas Electronics Corporation and NXPÂ® Semiconductors N.V. have joined as new members. They join existing members Arm, Cypress, Data IO, Futurewei, Google, Linaro, ST Microelectronics and Texas Instruments. You can read the complete press release [here](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/news/Renesas-and-NXP-announcement/).

The Trusted Firmware Project is designed to reduce porting and integration work across the ecosystem by creating reusable reference implementations for SoC and Trusted OS developers. The project collaborates on the development of Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A), Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) and OP-TEE.

This gives SoC developers and OEMs a reference trusted code base complying with the relevant Arm specifications and forms the foundations of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on application processors, or the Secure Processing Environment (SPE) on microcontrollers. The collaborative design, development and validation amongst the project members allows faster and cost-effective deployment of secure devices.

Membership of the Trusted Firmware Project is separate from Linaro membership and Linaro membership is not required. Governance is overseen by a board of member representatives while Linaro provides legal and financial hosting and support.
