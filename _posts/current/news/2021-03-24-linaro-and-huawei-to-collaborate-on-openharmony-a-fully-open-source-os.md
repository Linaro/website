Linaro Ltd, the open-source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm® ecosystem, today announced the joint collaboration with Huawei on OpenHarmony. Linaro will collaborate with Huawei and the open-source community on the engineering work needed to make OpenHarmony fully open-source.

In order to support the increasing demand of intensive AI workloads, several key challenges need to be addressed. Cloud infrastructures and datacenters need to evolve to allow for a more lightweight infrastructure able to deliver the best performance. 

OpenHarmony is an open-source operating system targeting the concept of distributed devices and shared pool of resources. The unified OS architecture is designed for multiple scenarios, allowing on-demand deployment for diversified devices, while adapting to different hardware resources and requirements for device functions. By enabling devices to intelligently communicate in an open, collaborative and transparent way, OpenHarmony is looking to provide a seamless user experience which improves a user’s daily life. 

The Arm ecosystem has grown to become a key platform for everything from devices to cloud datacenters. Linaro plays an essential role in the Arm ecosystem, having driven open-source collaboration on Arm since 2010. Linaro will drive the engineering work needed to make the operating system fully open source. Bringing the engineering aspect to Linaro allows the project to reach the wider open-source community, while also leveraging the extensive work Linaro and Huawei already collaborate on. This work includes monthly GNU toolchain integration builds, 
advanced build and test automation technologies, six-year LTS Linux, RTOS and trusted firmware for Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers, and Yocto and OPTEE for Arm Cortex-A microprocessors.

At this year’s Linaro Connect 2021, Huawei will deliver a keynote on its vision for where this all leads: Building the Future of Pervasive, Collaborative Intelligence with Arm and Open Source.

“We are focused on bringing intelligent capabilities into all aspects of people’s lives across all sorts of devices and cloud environments,” said Bryan Che, Huawei Chief Strategy Officer. “Arm is foundational to this, and we are building two complementary, open-source operating systems to enable pervasive, collaborative intelligence. OpenHarmony provides a distributed operating system across multiple devices, and OpenEuler brings tremendous benefits to the edge and cloud. We are excited to share more about our work and collaborate with everyone at Linaro Connect 2021.”

“We are thrilled to have Linaro endorsing OpenHarmony efforts”, said Davide Ricci, Director of Huawei’s European Open-Source Technology Center. “With their help we can rapidly and efficiently scale to support a broad variety of systems on chips and foster the endorsement and adoption from the Arm ecosystem. Linaro does a fantastic job in gathering Arm strategic players at the same table and from there reach out into the open-source ecosystem very effectively. We are jazzed to have Linaro’s team at our side.”

“OpenHarmony will enable users to enjoy a fully immersive and integrated experience across all their smart devices. It will also greatly simplify application development for software vendors and content providers who will only need to develop one application once, which can then be deployed seamlessly to multiple devices”, said Andrea Gallo, VP of Membership Development at Linaro. “Linaro is proud to lead the engineering work needed to deliver this innovative open-source operating system and is pleased to partner with Huawei to grow the European 
ecosystem for the OpenHarmony OS.”

**About Linaro** 

Linaro leads collaboration in the Arm ecosystem and helps companies work with the latest open-source technology. The company has over 250 engineers working on more than 70 open-source projects, developing and optimizing software and tools, ensuring smooth product roll outs, and reducing maintenance costs. Work happens across a wide range of technologies including artificial intelligence, automotive, datacenter & cloud, edge & fog computing, high performance computing, IoT & embedded and mobile. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce costly and unnecessary fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top ten company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10. To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online.
