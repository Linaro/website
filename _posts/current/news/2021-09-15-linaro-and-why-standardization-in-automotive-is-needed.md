Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm® ecosystem, today announced the availability of a white paper on the need for standardization in automotive. Linaro has a track record of bringing Arm vendors together on the Linux kernel and is currently extending this to automotive and the software defined vehicle momentum with projects such as Project Stratos, OP-TEE, Trusted Substrate and Linaro’s Kernel Functional Test. [To download the White Paper “Software Defined Vehicles and the need for standardisation” click here](https://static.linaro.org/assets/automotive_white_paper_0921.pdf).

Most devices nowadays - smartphones, computers - are intelligent, connected and continuously updated. In order for cars to evolve into connected devices we need to rethink how we build them and move towards software development. While some work is happening which is bringing us closer to the software defined vehicle there is still a long way to go.

From vendor lock-in, secure and reliable VM-to-VM communication, the challenges of continually updating software to latency and the need for a defined fast path - Linaro is addressing several of the challenges faced through the following open source projects:

**About Project Stratos**
[Project Stratos](https://linaro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STR/overview) addresses the need for reducing the application lock-in inherent in the current mix of Hypervisor and SoC proprietary solutions. Its aim is to establish virtio interfaces complying with the OASIS Virtual I/O Device (VIRTIO) specification. Project Stratos also generates open-source implementations of the front and backends for that specification.

**About OP-TEE**
[OP-TEE](https://www.op-tee.org/) contains a full implementation to make a complete Trusted Execution Environment. It has been used in production on all sorts of devices like mobile phones, tablets, laptops and surveillance cameras for many years. All of this was made possible by Linaro in 2014 when OP-TEE became an open source project.

**About Trusted Substrate**
[Trusted Substrate](/automotive-iot-and-edge-devices/) is a collaborative project for the integrated, tested and packaged foundation of open source secure boot and trusted execution environments. The project brings standards based secure booting and over-the-air (OTA) updates to the most trust demanding embedded computing projects such as automotive and robotics.

**About Linaro’s Linux Kernel Functional Test (LKFT)**
Linaro’s Linux Kernel Quality program covers both Linux kernel testing and testing of the LTS-derived Android-Common Kernel. [Linaro’s Linux Kernel Functional Testing](https://lkft.linaro.org/) (LKFT) framework (LKFT) is the most reliable Linux long-term-stable functional test framework in the industry.

In addition to these projects, Linaro is also collaborating with Arm and ecosystem leaders in the automotive supply chain on the Scalable Open Architecture for Embedded Edge (SOAFEE) initiative. [Announced earlier today](https://www.arm.com/company/news/2021/09/new-arm-technologies-to-transform-the-software-defined-future-for-the-automotive-industry), the aim of SOAFEE is to accelerate the automotive industry’s software-defined future by bringing real-time and safety needs of automotive together with the advantages of a cloud-native approach.

**About Linaro**
Linaro leads collaboration in the Arm ecosystem and helps companies work with the latest open source technology. The company has over 250 engineers working on more than 70 open source projects, developing and optimizing software and tools, ensuring smooth product roll outs, and reducing maintenance costs. Work happens across a wide range of technologies including artificial intelligence, automotive, datacenter & cloud, edge & fog computing, high performance computing, IoT & embedded and mobile. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce costly and unnecessary fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top ten company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10.
To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online. To find out more, please visit <https://www.linaro.org> and <https://www.96Boards.org>.
