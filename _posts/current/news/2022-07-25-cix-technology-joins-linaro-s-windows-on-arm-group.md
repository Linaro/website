Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm® ecosystem, today announced that CIX Technology Inc (CIX Technology) has joined Linaro as a Member of Linaro’s Windows on Arm Group. 

The Windows on Arm Group aims to establish a healthy self-sustaining Arm open source ecosystem for Windows. By delivering support to a diverse set of tools, languages and frameworks, the group is empowering engineers to develop natively on Windows on Arm and recompile faster. Achievements so far include [the availability of the Windows 10 on Arm bot support and binary](https://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-arm-and-qualcomm-collaborate-to-enable-native-llvm-for-windows-10-on-arm/) as part of the LLVM 12.0.0 release and Qt 6.2 being released with Windows on Arm hardware as a technology preview. 

CIX Technology’s vision is to drive intelligent computing for Arm based client devices. The company is joining the group to help advance the global Windows on Arm ecosystem by looking at tools for Arm native development and promoting them in the local market. The company also plans to work with Linaro on developing an Arm SystemReady™ compliant boot architecture implementation, which is critical for OEM/ODM customers wanting to create Arm-based personal computing client devices.

“We’re seeing big momentum with regards to Arm architecture adoption in the PC market segment, and our goal is to design Arm-compatible intelligent computing solutions for Windows devices” said Gang Liu, Co-founder & Software Engineering VP at CIX Technology. “In order to achieve this we need a strong Arm open source ecosystem which supports application migration and native development on Windows.
