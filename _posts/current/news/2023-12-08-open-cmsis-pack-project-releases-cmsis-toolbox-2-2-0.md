The Open CMSIS Pack project, which is hosted by Linaro, has released CMSIS-Toolbox Version 2.2.0. CMSIS-Toolbox provides a set of command-line tools to work with software packs in Open-CMSIS-Pack format.

CMSIS-Toolbox Version 2.2.0 contains:

Package Installer 2.0.0\
Project Manager 2.2.0\
Build Manager 2.2.0\
Build Invocation Utility 2.2.0\
Pack Verification 1.4.1\
System View Verification 3.3.46\
Generator Bridge 0.9.1

\
Supported platforms: Windows-amd64, Windows-arm64, Linux-amd64, Linux-arm64, macOS-amd64, macOS-arm64.

The Open-CMSIS-Pack project delivers the infrastructure to integrate and manage software components and improve code reuse across embedded and IoT projects. Software compatibility for component re-use has long been a challenge in the microcontroller space, especially for the IoT and its diversity at the hardware level. Open-CMSIS-Pack helps to address this complexity, by delivering a standard for software component packaging and related foundation tools for validation, distribution, integration, management, and maintenance.

Open-CMSIS-Pack is a public project hosted by Linaro. Anyone is welcome to bring relevant participation to the mailing list and in the public weekly technical meeting. More details of the project, list and meetings can be found at <https://www.open-cmsis-pack.org/> and at <https://linaro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CMSIS/overview>.
