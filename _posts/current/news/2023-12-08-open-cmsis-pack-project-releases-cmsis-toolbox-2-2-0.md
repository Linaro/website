The Open CMSIS Pack project, which is hosted by Linaro, has released CMSIS-Toolbox Version 2.2.0. CMSIS-Toolbox provides a set of command-line tools to work with software packs in Open-CMSIS-Pack format.

CMSIS-Toolbox 2.2.0 adds [generator integration](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/build-operation.md#generator-integration), extends [translation controls](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/YML-Input-Format.md#translation-control), adds [context set](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/build-overview.md#working-with-context-set), adds [pack locking](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/YML-CBuild-Format.md#pack-locking), and improves [linker script management](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/build-overview.md#linker-script-management). Refer to [release information](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/releases/tag/2.2.0) for more details.

CMSIS-Toolbox Version 2.2.0 contains:

Package Installer 2.0.0\
Project Manager 2.2.0\
Build Manager 2.2.0\
Build Invocation Utility 2.2.0\
Pack Verification 1.4.1\
System View Verification 3.3.46\
Generator Bridge 0.9.1

\
Supported platforms: Windows-amd64, Windows-arm64, Linux-amd64, Linux-arm64, macOS-amd64, macOS-arm64.

The Open-CMSIS-Pack project delivers the infrastructure to integrate and manage software components and improve code reuse across embedded and IoT projects. Software compatibility for component re-use has long been a challenge in the microcontroller space, especially for the IoT and its diversity at the hardware level. Open-CMSIS-Pack helps to address this complexity, by delivering a standard for software component packaging and related foundation tools for validation, distribution, integration, management, and maintenance.

Open-CMSIS-Pack is a public project hosted by Linaro. Anyone is welcome to bring relevant participation to the mailing list and in the public weekly technical meeting.
