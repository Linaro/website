### NXM Labs Inc. and Open Mobile Platform LLC join the Trusted Firmware Project

*\[Cambridge, Tuesday 5 January 2021]* Trusted Firmware, the open governance community project hosted by Linaro Community Projects, today announced that NXM Labs Inc. and Open Mobile Platform LLC have joined the Trusted Firmware Project. Members to date include Arm, Cypress, Futurewei, Google, Linaro, NXP, Renesas, and ST Microelectronics.

"NXM fully embraces the open standards emerging from TrustedFirmware.org that establish a consistent security foundation across the entire spectrum of IoT-capable chips, from low-cost Arm® Cortex®-M processors up to powerful Cortex-A processors," said Scott Rankine, CEO of NXM Labs. "This unlocks opportunities for value-added security service providers such as NXM to create security differentiation higher up the networking stack including, for example, our Autonomous Security capabilities." 

"We sincerely believe the new era of mobile technologies needs another level of mobile security everyone can trust. The Trusted Firmware project brings cutting edge security to Arm-based devices", said Pavel Eyges, CEO of Open Mobile Platform LLC, "Our team develops the Aurora corporate mobile operating system, and we are passionate to join the project and enrich it with our deep mobile tech and security expertise from which the entire community will benefit."

“Thriving ecosystems of secure connected devices require everyone involved to join forces,” said Shebu Varghese Kuriakose, chairman of the board for the Trusted Firmware Project and director of Software Technology Management at Arm. “The Trusted Firmware Project provides a platform for organizations to collaboratively design and develop secure software at scale. New members NXM Labs and Open Mobile Platform, with their extensive experience in security, bring great value to this partnership.”

The Trusted Firmware Project is designed to reduce porting and integration work across the ecosystem by creating reusable reference implementations for SoC and Trusted OS developers. The project collaborates on the development of Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A), Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M), OP-TEE, Mbed TLS and Hafnium.

TF-A is the reference Secure world software for Arm Cortex-A and Arm Neoverse™ processors across all market segments. TF-M is the reference implementation of architecture specifications provided by Arm for meeting the [PSA Certified](https://www.psacertified.org/) requirements on Arm Cortex-M processors, accelerating the route to certification. OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as a companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm Cortex-A processors using [Arm TrustZone® technology. ](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/security-ip/trustzone/trustzone-for-cortex-a)

Mbed™ TLS is an extensively used SSL and TLS library deployed in a wide variety of applications to establish secure, encrypted and authenticated links over untrusted networks like the internet. Hafnium comes as the reference Secure Partition Manager for the Arm Secure EL2 virtualization extension introduced in the Armv8.4-A architecture and implemented on modern Arm A-Profile processors. 

This gives SoC developers and OEMs a reference trusted code base complying with the relevant Arm specifications and forms the foundations of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on application processors, or the Secure Processing Environment (SPE) on microcontrollers. The collaborative design, development and validation amongst the project members allow faster and cost-effective deployment of secure devices.

**About Linaro and Linaro Community Projects**
Linaro leads collaboration on open source development in the Arm ecosystem and Linaro Community Projects is the dedicated division of Linaro Limited managing open governance, open source, community projects. Linaro has over 200 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the Arm architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, Arm power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low-level fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top ten company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10. To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online.
