Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm® ecosystem, today announced the availability of a white paper on the importance of standardized firmware and its efforts to do so. Linaro has a track record of bringing Arm vendors together on the Linux kernel and is currently extending this to firmware with the Trusted Substrate Project.

Technologies such as IoT, AR, VR, Robotics and Machine Learning are increasingly part of our everyday lives and it is clear that we are heading in the direction of always being connected and online. While this connected world delivers countless benefits, it also presents challenges for those building the IoT solutions. How do you keep data secure and protect devices from cyber attacks? How do you keep devices up to date with the latest software? And how do you do all of this in a cost-effective and sustainable way?

Linaro has gathered perspectives from companies such as Bosch Rexroth, Microsoft, Red Hat and ST Microelectronics to understand the obstacles they face when building IoT solutions. From the mismatch between the lifetime of a machine vs the lifetime of the embedded technology, to the lack of integration between firmware components, the wide range of diverse use cases and the challenge of securing devices at scale - one thing is clear. Everyone is spending an excessive amount of time on solving problems which are common to all. The only way to tackle these challenges is through open standards and open interfaces.

**About Trusted Substrate**

Trusted Substrate is a collaborative project for the integrated, tested and packaged foundation of open source secure boot and trusted execution environments. The project is a BIOS which brings standards based secure booting and over-the-air (OTA) updates to the most trust demanding embedded computing projects such as automotive and robotics. By choosing Trusted Substrate enabled boards, product makers can rest assured that the behavior of their product will be consistent across SoCs and boards. To find out more about the Trusted Substrate Project, go to [www.linaro.org/trusted-substrate](/automotive-iot-and-edge-devices/).

**About Linaro**

Linaro leads collaboration in the Arm ecosystem and helps companies work with the latest open source technology. The company has over 250 engineers working on more than 70 open source projects, developing and optimizing software and tools, ensuring smooth product roll outs, and reducing maintenance costs. Work happens across a wide range of technologies including artificial intelligence, automotive, datacenter & cloud, edge & fog computing, high performance computing, IoT & embedded and mobile. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce costly and unnecessary fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top ten company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online. To find out more, please visit <https://www.linaro.org> and <https://www.96Boards.org>.
