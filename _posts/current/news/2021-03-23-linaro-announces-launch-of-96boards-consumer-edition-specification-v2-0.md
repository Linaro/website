Linaro Ltd, the open-source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm® ecosystem, today announced the publication of 96Boards Consumer Edition Specification v2.0. The new specification is available to download [here](https://www.96boards.org/specifications/).

96Boards is Linaro’s initiative to build a single software and hardware community across low-cost development boards based on Arm technology. The consumer edition provides developers with a low cost platform for running standard Linux-based OS, including Android. It is targeted at open source community software development, the maker community and embedded system OEMs requiring low cost off-the-shelf CPU modules. 

The Consumer Edition Specification v 2.0 has been updated to address the ever-increasing demands of high performance computing applications such as AI, mixed-reality, intelligent HMI, automotive and 5G. As a result, it includes additional low and high speed communication interfaces, PCIe for external acceleration or 5G modems, ethernet, field buses, multi-cameras and multi-display interfaces such as CSI-2/DSI/LVDS/eDP.

“In recognition of the significant progress that has been made in silicon and IP development, 96Boards Consumer Edition V2.0 shows our continued commitment to building a coherent ecosystem around the latest and greatest silicon technology”, said Dr. Yang Zhang, Director of 96Boards at Linaro. ”We recognise the diverse use cases supported by the availability of AI accelerators and we see the need for standardised connectivity which was apparent in products developed against the V1.0 specification. We also understand the need for increased levels of IP integration such as PCIe, USB3 and multiple MIPI interfaces for advanced applications. We have addressed all of these challenges in the 96Boards Consumer Edition V2.0 specification. Whilst doing so, we have kept backward compatibility so that products designed using the new specification will be able to leverage the same mezzanine ecosystem built around the previous V1.0 specification.” 

**The 96Boards Consumer Edition Specification v2.0 includes the following features:**

96Boards Manufacturing Partner Beiqi Cloud has developed two new boards which are compliant with the new specification. The TB-96AIoT-1126CE is based on Rockchip’s RV1126 while the TB-96AI-3568-CE is based on the RK3568 platform. The two boards can share one mezzanine board and will be available to purchase in May from [here](https://www.beiqicloud.com).

The TB-96AIoT-1126CE (which is based on Rockchip RV1126) is a low cost platform with integrated ISP and dual camera, TPU and ethernet port.  It can be used in a wide range of different scenarios , such as:

* IPC Smart Webcam Product
* Battery IPC, Smart DoorBell, Cat Eye Products
* Gate Lock/Access Control/Attendance Products
* Education and Training Industry
* Internet of Things Artificial Intelligence Other Application Fields

The TB-96AI-3568-CE (which is based on Rockchip RK3568) supports Quad core Arm Cortex A55, Mali-G522EE GPU,0.8Tops NPU RKNN, 4K H.264/H.265 decode, multi channel video decoding, as well as colorful high speed interfaces such as PCIe/SATA/ETH and multi display interfaces. It is mainly used in mid to high end applications such as IoT gateways, NVR storage, industrial control panels, industrial detection, industrial control boxes, karaoke, cloud terminals and vehicle central control.
