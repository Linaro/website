Linaro Ltd, the collaborative engineering organization developing software for the Arm® ecosystem, announced today that the company has appointed Grant Likely as its new CTO. 

Grant has over 25 years experience in software development. Before becoming Linaro’s CTO, Grant was the Senior Technical Director in the Architecture Group at Arm where he was responsible for the SystemReady IR program. From 2013-2016 Grant was a Linaro Fellow in the CTO office, helping shape Linaro’s overall technical strategy. Over the years he has also become well known in the Linux kernel development community as the previous Devicetree maintainer. 

Given Grant’s background at Arm, Linaro, and as part of the open source community, he is perfectly positioned to take on the role as Linaro’s new CTO. 

“We are so pleased to see Grant join Linaro as the new CTO”, said Li Gong, Linaro CEO. “His experience in the open source community and as part of the Linaro CTO office gives him a unique perspective and understanding for how to drive the Arm ecosystem forward through collaboration.”

“Working as part of the Linux kernel community I got to see first hand the power of collaboration” said Grant Likely. “Linaro plays an instrumental role in bringing industry and community together to collaborate on Arm software and I am thrilled to help shape the technical strategy which supports this crucial collaboration.”
