Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the ArmÂ® ecosystem, today announced that OPPO has joined Linaro as a Project Member of [the Kernel Development targeting Android Project](https://linaro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LCGSC/pages/15846998590/Kernel+Development+Targeting+Android). 

OPPO is one of the world's leading innovators and manufacturers of smart devices, with operations in over 50 countries and regions. The company created the world's first rollable smartphone OPPO X and produces smartphones, smart devices, audio devices, as well as software and internet services built around its ColorOS operating system enjoyed by 440 million monthly active users worldwide

OPPO is continuously deepening its collaboration with Android. Linaro has a team of experts and a strong track record in upstreaming Arm software to Android. Becoming a Linaro member is the logical next step in OPPO's aim to deliver the most up-to-date software and to reduce the cost of maintaining out-of-tree code. 

Linaro plays a key role in upstreaming Arm open-source software to Android, and by working with Linaro, leading device makers like OPPO will be able to accelerate the pace to secure, connected smart devices to their users.

"We are really excited to see OPPO - one of the world's leading smartphone device manufacturers - join forces with Linaro and its members," said Andrea Gallo, VP of Business Development at Linaro. "We believe their expertise will bring a lot of value and look forward to collaborating with them to accelerate the optimization of ODM code partitions and the deployment of more secure updates"
