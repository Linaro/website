Linaro, the leading engineering organization that drives the best-in-class development in the Arm ecosystem, announces today that Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. has joined the Linaro Edge Group (LEDGE). 

This integration will further strengthen the long-term relationship among the two companies and intends to set a milestone on the development and support of Linux-based Arm edge devices in the IoT and industrial IoT industries. 

The Linaro Edge Group (LEDGE) has been created to address the significant challenges that device makers and silicon vendors face when bringing Linux-based Arm edge devices to market and providing lifetime software support. By working collaboratively, Linaro Edge members identify, select, integrate and test all the necessary building blocks ensuring security-focused, reliable operations across the different market segments. 

Such building blocks are at the foundation of Linaro Edge reference Yocto Project runtime images that run across a variety of SoCs and are continuously tested against functional regressions as well as compliance with leading industry interoperability standards, including [System Ready - IR](https://www.arm.com/architecture/system-architectures/systemready-certification-program/ir).

The addition of Qualcomm Technologies strengthens the presence of Linaro Edge Group in the robotics ecosystem, as well as the list of SoCs supported by the Group. More specifically, LEDGE supports the entire family of popular Qualcomm® Robotics Platforms, which include Qualcomm Robotics RB5, Qualcomm Robotics RB3, Qualcomm Robotics RB2, and Qualcomm Robotics RB1. 

The combination of LEDGE Linux reference runtime and Qualcomm Robotics Platforms enables the development of intelligent robots by combining high-performance heterogeneous computing, on-device AI/machine learning, and advanced computer vision with robust security, multimedia, Wi-Fi and 4G and/or 5G cellular connectivity capabilities.

“We’re thrilled to welcome Qualcomm Technologies as a member of the Linaro LEDGE group,” said Andrea Gallo, VP Business Developement at Linaro. “The power of the Qualcomm Robotics Platforms and a System Ready compliant, fully open-source Linux stack are great accelerators to the transformation that the Manufacturing industry is going through and the push toward the Software Defined Factory.” 

“Qualcomm Technologies is excited to work with Linaro on LEDGE to help expand collaboration with industry leaders around the development of Linux-based Arm edge devices across various segments of the IoT ecosystem with an initial focus on SystemReady-IR,” said Guru Chinnabhandar, Senior Director of Engineering, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. “LEDGE offers an integration and test lab for Qualcomm Robotics platforms, and we support their focus on continuous integration and industry standard development practices.”
