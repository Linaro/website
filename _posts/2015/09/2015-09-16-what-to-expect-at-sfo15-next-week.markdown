Welcome to [Linaro Connect San Francisco 2015!](https://connect.linaro.org/sfo15/)
We are returning to the [Hyatt Regency Hotel](https://www.hyatt.com/) in Burlingame, CA which is conveniently located next to the San Francisco airport. Hence, the shortcut reference of SFO15.

Why the same venue? It could be because we were hoping to overlap with the YaoiCon[1] convention as we did last year. Trust me, that is definitely not the reason although the convention was a topic of some interesting hallway discussions. As with most Connects, this venue offers a combination of convenience to a major airport as well as access to a cosmopolitan city with great people, restaurants, nightlif and attractions. In addition, the San Francisco Bay Area is a world center of innovation and is home (headquarters or major facility) for many of our member companies. 

This Connect will be similar in format to HKG15 (translation, Linaro Connect Hong Kong 2015). The overall theme for the week will be security and there will be daily themes for each of the four segment groups. Simon Segars (Arm CEO) and George Grey (Linaro CEO) will be kicking off the week on Monday with opening keynotes. Expect to hear a glimpse of things to come for Arm and the Arm Ecosystem.

There will be daily keynote speakers on Tuesday through Friday presenting topics relevant to the segment group theme of the day. Keynote speakers include Neil Trevett (VP Mobile Ecosystems, Nvidia), John Simmons (Media Platform Architect, Microsoft), Suresh Gopalakrishnan (VP & GM - Server, AMD), Dave Neary (SDN/NFV Community Strategy, Red Hat) and Karen Sandler (Executive Director, Software Freedom Conservancy). We have a surprise second keynote speaker on Thursday. A surprise because, as I write this blog, we haven’t finalized who it will be yet. Not to worry, it will be someone and something of interest. On Friday there will be a panel discussion on security. The panel will tell us what we should know, think we know or are afraid to know about this timely and critical topic.

SFO15 has special significance to those who have been with Linaro since the beginning (2010). It is the five-year anniversary of Linaro and we are planning to have some fun during the Gala dinner on Thursday night at the Computer History Museum[2]. Some of you may remember we visited the museum at a previous Linaro Connect several years ago. However, this visit will be a bit different. How different? Sign-up for the Gala dinner to find out. There will be a limited number of seats so I recommend signing up early.

And, of course, it will be a week full of interesting sessions, demos, hacking (the good kind), meetings, discussions, good food and good people.

Speaking of good people, what will Andrew Wafaa do to amaze us this Connect?

See you all in San Francisco!
