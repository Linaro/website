Cambridge, UK; 29 October 2015

Linaro Ltd, the collaborative engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, today announced that Acadine Technologies has become the first systems software company to join the Linaro Mobile Group (LMG).

LMG was formed in July 2014 to consolidate and optimize open source software for ARM powered mobile phones, tablets, laptops and wearables. The Group's engineers work have been focused on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), performance and power optimizations, graphics and GPGPU, and work with other groups in Linaro Core Engineering on other open source technologies.

“We are delighted to welcome Acadine Technologies as the first systems software company to become a member of the Linaro Mobile Group”, said Robert Booth, Linaro’s Chief Operating Officer (COO). “Mobile vendors are continually looking for a choice of operating systems and H5OS is a new and very interesting option that provides flexibility and customization for partners. We look forward to working closely with Acadine and the other LMG vendors to ensure the best possible open source mobile software is readily available.”

Acadine Technologies is a systems software company specializing in innovative mobile operating systems for mobile, wearable, and IoT devices. Acadine’s core product, called H5OS, is a web-centric operating system that is primarily based on HTML5, one of the open standard technologies of the modern Internet.

“Acadine is committed to make H5OS an innovative open mobile operating system and we’re very excited to join Linaro,” said Dr. Li Gong, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Acadine. “We believe that Linaro’s experience in working with open source projects and the engineering resources that it and its members can apply to developing and optimizing platforms like H5OS will help us make our core product ecosystem-friendly to the community and customers around the world.”

**About Linaro**
Linaro is leading collaboration on open source development in the ARM ecosystem. The company has over 250 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the ARM architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, ARM power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro’s growing membership, and by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top five company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online. To find out more, please visit []() and [http://www.96Boards.org](http://www.96boards.org).

**About H5OS**
A completely web-centric operating system, H5OS eliminates the native APIs that give the conventional mobile OS owners full business control over other mobile industry participants. As a result, H5OS offers the huge potential of a simpler technical architecture, more efficient memory and power consumption, and completely dynamic and seamless interactions between the mobile operating system, on-device applications, and the millions of web apps and services on the Internet at large.

The H5OS open architecture also brings about an open mobile ecosystem with open participation, thus enabling choices for everyone, from device makers to operators to consumers, to freely select and experience the best of the web.
