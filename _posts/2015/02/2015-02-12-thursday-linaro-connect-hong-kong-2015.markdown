Thursday began as each day of Connect has with a guest keynote. The guest keynote for Thursday was given by Warren Rehman, Android Partner Engineering Manager at Google. Warren gave an overview of what Android TV is in context of Android. He went on to discuss expectations for consumer electronics and how this impacts Android TV to try to address these expectations. He also talked about Android security and the multiple layers of defense they have as well as the Android security model.
