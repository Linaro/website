We are returning to Hong Kong for this year’s[ Linaro Connect](http://connect.linaro.org/hkg15/) in Asia. Hong Kong is such a great city with lots of restaurants, night life, culture and the awesome Symphony of Lights [1] that was named the “World's Largest Permanent Light and Sound Show by Guinness World Records”.

This year the event will be held at the [Regal Airport Hotel](http://www.regalhotel.com/regal-airport-hotel/en/home/home.html) that is conveniently located at the Hong Kong International Airport. You will be able to literally walk from the airport to your hotel room in just a few minutes!

Linaro Connect continues to expand in testament to the growing interest and importance of ARM technology to the Linux community and ARM ecosystem. There are over 480 people registered to attend this time. This is well above any previous Connect registrations prior to the event.

We will continue the Linaro Theme days that we introduced at Linaro Connect USA 2014. Theme days are keynotes and sessions focused around the Linaro Segment Groups: LEG - Enterprise Server, LNG - Networking, LHG - Digital Home and LMG - Mobile. For this Connect we have added a new Theme day for the Engineering Community.

**The Theme days are:**

**Monday - Community**
**Tuesday - Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG)**
**Wednesday - Linaro Networking Group (LNG) and Linaro Mobile Group (LMG)**
**Thursday - Linaro Digital Home Group (LHG)**

Monday, is of course, opening day. George Grey, Linaro CEO, will delivery his [opening keynote](https://hkg15.pathable.com/meetings/250753). Expect a bit of ‘shock and awe’ as George announces something new and exciting from Linaro. This has been in the works for several months and promises to be a significant boost for the community of ARM developers. That’s all I can say at the moment. George has sworn me to secrecy. You won’t want to miss this keynote!

We have also switched things around on Monday. After the opening keynote, the engineering teams will gather for individual kick-off meetings. The kick-off meetings will be an opportunity for the teams to do their ‘meet-n-greet’ and prepare for their sessions, hacking and week of social activities. Although the teams regularly meet by video, audio and Internet chat, they only see each other face-to-face a few times a year.  Social interaction is still very important to biology-based lifeforms (computers haven’t taken control yet :) [2,3]). Monday afternoon will be the start of sessions for the week. These sessions will include interesting topics relevant to the community of developers.

Monday afternoon, Tuesday through Thursday mornings, and Friday morning are packed with sessions on a variety of topics ranging from ARMv8, U-Boot64, ARM Coresight, ACPI, UEFI, ODP (OpenDataPlane), Chromium Blink and EME, OP-TEE, ARM Trustzone, building for 64-bit AOSP and Energy Aware Scheduling (EAS) to name just a few. A series of training events, some updated from Linaro Connect USA 2014 and a few new ones, are scheduled in the afternoons on Tuesday through Thursday. Check the [full schedule](https://hkg15.pathable.com/meetings) for a day-by-day list of all the sessions.

The now famous [Linaro Awards Dinner ](http://connect.linaro.org/hkg15/)will be on Thursday evening. All registered guests are invited.

Greg Kroah-Hartman (aka, Greg KH) will give the closing keynote on Friday morning with an update on “How Linaro is doing?” (from the Linux kernel community perspective). Greg gave some interesting, useful (and a few critical) insights during Linaro Connect Asia 2013.  Have we exceeded his expectations? We will know the answer on Friday morning.

After the Friday keynote and mornings sessions, Joe Bates will provide his closing summary of the week followed by lunch, refreshments and a number of interesting[ technology demos](http://connect.linaro.org/hkg15/).

See you all in Hong Kong!
