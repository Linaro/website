## Marvell invests in enabling the open source development community with the development of a new cost-effective quad-core ARM 64-bit development board

HONG KONG, China; 9 FEBRUARY 2015

Linaro Ltd, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, today at Linaro Connect Hong Kong 2015 announced that leading silicon solution provider Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) has joined Linaro as a founding member of the new Linaro Community Boards Group (LCG).

Marvell, a worldwide leader in providing complete silicon solutions from mobile communications to storage, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud infrastructure, digital entertainment and in-home content delivery and Kinoma® software has joined the LCG to deliver a highly integrated quad-core 64-bit ARMADA® Mobile PXA1928 platform in an easily accessible format to software developers, OEMs and hobbyists around the world.

The [ARMADA Mobile PXA1928 was announced](http://www.marvell.com/company/news/pressDetail.do?releaseID=5078) in February 2014 and has been [named](https://plus.google.com/+GoogleATAP/posts/CNa71nE6kfN) as one of the processors being used in the Google Project Ara application processor module reference designs. The multi-mode LTE System-on-Chip (SoC) is already running Linux and Android in various devices such as tablets and smartphones, and Marvell plans to release a [96Boards](https://www.96boards.org/) compatible platform based on this processor in the next few weeks. This will bring the functionality of these shipping devices onto the desks of developers where they can easily develop and optimize the operating systems and applications for both existing and new devices.

“Linaro has been working closely with Marvell on Project Ara and we are excited that the ARMADA Mobile PXA1928 will be available to developers on an easily accessible board,” said George Grey, CEO of Linaro. “I’m very pleased to welcome Marvell as a founding member of the Linaro Community Boards group and I look forward to the launch of their 96Boards compatible product in the next few weeks.”

The LCG has been formed to support the new 96Boards initiative. 96Boards is the first open hardware specification that provides a platform for the delivery of compatible low-cost, small footprint 32-bit and 64-bit Cortex-A boards. Standardized expansion buses for peripheral I/O, display and cameras allow the hardware ecosystem to develop a range of compatible add-on products that will work on 96Boards products over the lifetime of the platform. The LCG Steering Committee will manage the evolution of the 96Boards open specifications and the development of the 96Boards community. The 96Boards website provides software downloads and updates, information on compatible products, and forums for software developers, makers and OEMs to get community software support and downloads for all 96Boards products.

“As a founding member of the Linaro Community Boards Group (LCG), Marvell is pleased to participate in the launch of the 96Boards initiative,” said Philip Poulidis, Vice President and General Manager, Internet of Things Business Unit at Marvell. Linaro is a key place for collaborative software and hardware engineering on the ARM architecture and we are proud of our long-standing work with the ARM ecosystem, enabling the “Smart Life, Smart Lifestyle,” for consumers around the globe. We believe in providing cost-effective, best-in-class platforms for new developer communities to be able to create a wider array of applications with products such as the 64-bit quad core PXA1928.”
