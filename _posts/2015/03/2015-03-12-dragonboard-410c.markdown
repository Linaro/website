The DragonBoard 410c is based on the 64-bit capable Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 410 processor and is designed to be compatible with the 96Boards Consumer Edition specification. It should be commercially available this summer through distributors, but you can sign up now for more information, as it becomes available, at [http://developer.qualcomm.com/dragonboard410c](http://developer.qualcomm.com/dragonboard410c).

Qualcomm is positioning the board to bring the Snapdragon 410 processor’s high-performing, feature-rich functionality to a broader group of developers, makers and OEMs who can use the credit card-sized development kit for rapid software development and prototyping of new inventions and products. They expect the Snapdragon 410 processor to enable embedded solutions providers to support off-the-shelf or custom system-on-modules for commercial deployments. Products in these embedded computing and Internet of Everything (IoE) product categories include the next generation of robotics, cameras, set-top-boxes, wearables, medical devices, vending machines, building automation, industrial control, digital signage, and casino gaming consoles to name a few.

“The DragonBoard 410c is a powerful, low cost platform engineered to allow the rapid development of commercial solutions to address the expanding embedded compute and IoE industries across multiple operating systems.” said Jason Bremner, senior vice president of product management for Qualcomm Technologies. “The DragonBoard 410c will play a critical role in helping drive the innovation of embedded computing products on a global basis”

In addition to the Quad-core ARM® Cortex®-A53 processor running at up to 1.2 GHz per core, the DragonBoard 410C offers Qualcomm™ Adreno™ 306 GPU with 400MHz high quality graphics. On top of the expected features for a 96Boards product, Qualcomm has added integrated Qualcomm® IZat™ Gen8C location technology and an analog expansion connector (for headset, speaker and FM antenna).
