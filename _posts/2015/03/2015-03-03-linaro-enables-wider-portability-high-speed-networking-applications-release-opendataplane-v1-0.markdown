## OpenDataPlane (ODP) enables proven software portability between network compute platforms, regardless of the underlying instruction set architecture (ISA), as well as transparent support for any hardware or software acceleration capability.


Cambridge, UK; 3 March 2015

Linaro Ltd, the collaborative engineering organization developing open source software for its member companies, today announced the release of [OpenDataPlane](http://www.opendataplane.org/) version 1.0.

ODP is an open source, open contribution framework for portable, high performance data plane applications. Applications written to the ODP APIs can run on any ODP-enabled network compute platform, including System-on-Chip (SoC), general purpose processor (with or without additional network hardware acceleration) or Application Specific IC (ASIC) solutions. ODP-enabled platforms enjoy both portability and transparent access to any available hardware or software acceleration capabilities. In turn, platforms that support ODP can run any ODP application with a simple recompile. ODP implementations have been developed to support a variety of networking SoCs and processor architectures, including ARM, MIPS, Power Architecture, and x86.

The ODP open source framework has been developed by the [Linaro Networking Group (LNG)](https://wiki.linaro.org/LNG) since [October 2013](/news/linaro-launches-opendataplane-odp-project-deliver-open-source-cross-platform-interoperability-networking-platforms/) as a joint effort of many stakeholders, spanning both application providers and silicon vendors. These stakeholders have been working towards the common goal of providing a truly open source and cross-platform framework for portable application access to advanced hardware acceleration and offload capabilities provided by industry-leading network SoCs. The release of ODP v1.0 represents the completion of the first phase of ODP development, and provides a stable set of APIs suitable for widespread application development and evaluation. In 2015 ODP will continue to be developed to provide an enhanced set of APIs and implementations across a range of network compute platforms including multiple CPU architectures.

LNG members anticipate that ODP will be a key building block in the realization of SDN (Software Defined Networking) and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) solutions. The framework provides for the first time a portable cross-architecture design that can be used by application and platform providers to maximize the performance of their unique product capabilities.

Included in this release is the definition of the ODP v1.0 APIs, an open source reference implementation of these APIs that can run on any Linux platform, as well as a validation suite that can be used by ODP implementations to verify that they conform to the ODP v1.0 API set. Additional implementations of ODP v1.0 targeting specific SoC platforms will be announced by their respective owners in the coming weeks.

**ARM**

“OpenDataPlane has already demonstrated cross platform interoperability and has been identified as a critical upstream project for the network infrastructure market,” said Ian Drew, Chief Marketing Officer and EVP Business Development, ARM. “In reaching the ODP 1.0 release milestone, Linaro delivers a shining example of what can be accomplished through open source collaboration.”

**Cavium**

“All the members of the Linaro Networking Group (LNG) should be proud that with the release of OpenDataPlane (ODP) v1.0 the team has fulfilled the vision of creating a standard that can provide for cross platform compatibility at the API layer that is completely portable across a range of vendors’ processors including Cavium’s OCTEON and ThunderX product lines.” said Imran Badr, VP of Software Engineering, Cavium. “Cavium’s extensive experience in fast-path development has allowed us to utilize ODP to extract the maximum performance from our accelerated hardware to the point that it is on par with our bare metal implementations. Indeed at Mobile World Congress 2015 we are showing 100Gbps of IPSEC throughput utilizing ODP APIs on our OCTEON III CN78xx 48 core processor as well as a Virtualized Mobile Core (vEPC) demo also utilizing ODP APIs on our ThunderX ARMv8-A based cores in a completely virtualized environment. The growing third party support for the ODP ecosystem coupled with the work of the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV) project will help accelerate the evolution of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) initiatives.”

**ENEA**

"As a founding member of the Linaro Networking Group and contributor to the OpenDataPlane initiative, Enea is committed to working together with leading hardware vendors and customers on SDN- and NFV-enabling technologies", said Daniel Forsgren, SVP Product Management at Enea. "We are proud to be a key partner in the ARM ecosystem, developing and hardening optimal software solutions for tomorrow’s connected society."

**Freescale**

“Freescale was a major contributor to the development of ODP and is fully supportive of ODP’s charter of providing a truly open, truly multi-platform API for developing highly accelerated and virtualized networks,” said Raja Tabet, Vice President of Software and Systems for Freescale’s Digital Networking Group. “Freescale is also announcing support for ODP on our industry leading line of QorIQ multicore communications processors based on both ARM and Power Architectures”.

**MontaVista**

“With the release of ODP v1.0, a truly open, cross platform framework supporting multiple architectures becomes available to Network equipment providers and integrators to build and maintain advanced data plane applications easily. MontaVista has already engaged with key OEMs to integrate ODP applications with our Carrier Grade Edition Linux platforms and moving forward we will be supporting the latest advances in powerful ARM V8 SoCs such as Cavium’s ThunderX.” said Sanjay Raina, General Manager of MontaVista Software.

**Nokia Networks**

“Mobile broadband operators face a spread of challenges and exciting new opportunities to build profitability. Traffic growth continues almost unbounded, demanding new network capacity, yet traffic patterns are increasingly unpredictable. At the same time, providing a great network experience for subscribers is extremely important and will become critical as a principal driver of revenue. To meet these needs, operators require extreme flexibility in their network and operations to satisfy their customers by responding with rapid time-to-market performance. In parallel, they need to see a drastic reduction in their total ‘production’ cost per bit. OpenDataPlane is a continuation in our effort to provide better application portability, faster time-to-market, higher performance and lower power across all networking applications,” said Jarmo Hillo, Head of Processor Technology at Nokia Networks.
