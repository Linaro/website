## LeMaker to pair its hardware expertise with Linaro’s open source software experience to enable software developers with new 96Boards hardware platforms

Shen Zhen, China; 20 June 2015

Linaro Ltd, the not­-for-­profit engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, today at the Shen Zhen Maker Faire announced that Chinese Maker development platform vendor LeMaker has joined Linaro as a member of the new Linaro Community Boards Group (LCG).

The LCG has been formed to support the new 96Boards initiative. 96Boards is the first open hardware specification that provides a platform for the delivery of compatible low ­cost, small footprint 32­bit and 64­bit Cortex­A boards. Standardized expansion buses for peripheral I/O, display and cameras allow the hardware ecosystem to develop a range of compatible add­on products that will work on multiple vendor’s 96Boards products over the lifetime of the platform. The LCG Steering Committee will manage the evolution of the 96Boards open specifications and the development of the 96Boards community. The 96Boards website provides software downloads and updates, information on compatible products, and forums for software developers, makers and OEMs to get community software support and downloads for all 96Boards products.

“The China Maker and University markets are an incredibly large and fertile ground for innovation,” said Joe Bates, EVP of Member Services at Linaro. “We are very happy to be working with LeMaker to provide these markets with the latest ARMv8 hardware platforms at an affordable price with robust open source software support. We look forward to seeing what Chinese Makers and students can build on these platforms.”

LeMaker has joined the LCG to combine its professional experience of working with multiple SoC vendors and the LeMaker online community to deliver innovative development platforms to Chinese universities and the Maker community with Linaro's software expertise to deliver a new platform built on the latest Linux kernels and toolchains. This new platform is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of this year.

“As a member of the Linaro Community Boards Group (LCG), LeMaker is pleased to participate in the marketing of the 96Boards in Chinese Universities and the Maker market,” said Mr. Tony Zhang, Co­Founder of LeMaker. “Linaro is a key place for collaborative software and hardware engineering on the ARM architecture and we are proud of our long­standing work with the ARM ecosystem, enabling the ‘LeMaker makes innovations more easier,’ for consumers around the world. LeMaker has developed the open­source platform for Banana Pro and today released three new products alongside this announcement. We believe in providing cost-­effective, best-­in-­class platforms for new developers to be able to create a wider array of applications with our SBC platform.”
