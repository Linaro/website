The Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG) is pleased to announce the 16.12 release for the Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform. Click [here](http://releases.linaro.org/reference-platform/enterprise/16.12/?utm_source=platforms.linaro&utm_medium=submenu) to download the release.

The goal of the Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform is to provide a product quality, end to end, documented, open source platform for Arm based Enterprise servers. The Reference Platform includes boot firmware, kernel, a choice of userspace distributions and additional relevant open source projects. The Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform is built and tested on 96Boards RP-Certified hardware and the Linaro Developer Cloud. It is intended to be a reference example for use as a foundation for products based on open source technologies.

The Linaro Enterprise Group has worked closely with Linaro’s Core Technology & Tools teams to deliver the Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform with updates across the software stack (Firmware, Linux Kernel, and key server workloads) for Arm based Enterprise servers and a focus on QA testing and platform interoperability. OpenStack reference architecture is now available with ansible playbooks, allowing users to deploy an end to end Openstack reference on Arm servers. BigTop 1.1 has also been upgraded with OpenJDK 8, Spark 2.0 (from 1.6) and Hive 2.1 (from 1.2), all tested with Hadoop 2.7.2.
