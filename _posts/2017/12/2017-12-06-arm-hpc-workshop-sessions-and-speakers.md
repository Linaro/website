            Introduction of Post-K development
        </h4>

        <em>By</em> Yutaka Ishikawa, RIKEN AICS

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            Post-K is the next flagship supercomputer in Japan, replacement of the K supercomputer. Its node architecture and interconnect are based on ARMv8 SVE and a 6-D mesh/torus network, respectively. A three level hierarchical storage system will be installed with compute nodes. The system software developed in the post K supercomputer includes a novel operating system for general-purpose manycore architectures, low-level communication and MPI libraries, and file I/O middleware.

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            Post-K use Arm based super computer. But there are not too many Arm based servers for HPC.
            Therefore we think to need to build Arm HPC Ecosystem until Post-K release.
            In this presentation, we describe our collaboration efforts to build the Arm HPC Ecosystem.

            Arm tools and roadmap for SVE compiler support
        </h4>

        <em>By</em> Richard Sandiford, Florian Hahn (Arm), ARM

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            This presentation will give an overview of what Arm is doing to develop the HPC ecosystem, with a particular focus on SVE.  It will include a brief synopsis of both the commercial and open-source tools and libraries that Arm is developing and a description of the various community initiatives that Arm is involved in.  The bulk of the talk will describe the roadmap for SVE compiler support in both GCC and LLVM.  It will cover the work that has already been done to support both hand-optimised and automatically-vectorised code, and the plans for future improvements.

            HCQC : HPC Compiler Quality Checker
        </h4>

        <em>By</em> Masaki Arai, Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd.

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            For numerical calculation programs on supercomputers, the kernel part occupies 80% or more of the execution time in many cases.
            Therefore, the quality of the code generated by the compiler for these kernel parts is significant.
            We created a tool, which is called HCQC, to aid in the investigation of the quality of the code generated by the compiler for the kernel part.
            In this presentation, we report the details of HCQC and the results of evaluating the quality of GCC and LLVM when compiling the kernel part of benchmark programs using HCQC.

            State of the Scalasca Toolset
        </h4>

            <em>By</em> Itaru Kitayama, RIKEN AICS

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            Scalasca is a standardized toolset for parallel applications to evaluate their performance on HPC systems. In this talk, starting from the general introduction to the toolset, we’ll review the current state of Scalasca, focusing on the arm64 support. As of today Scalasca just works out of the box on arm64, except sampling mode support which is only available on x86 systems.  The on-going porting work to address this missing feature is presented in detail and also a major upgrade to their trace format called Online Trace Format (OTF) is summarized. As time permits, project outlook and demo slides actually carried on a Cavium ThunderX system will be given in the talk.

            An Evaluation of EasyBuild for Open Source Software Deployment

        <em>By</em> Takahiro Ogura, RIKEN

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            Sharing build procedures of Open Source Software (OSS) is critical to quick OSS deployment. It is difficult for us because our target architecture is ARM and the public know-hows are not abundant since ARM based HPC machines are not prevalent. We will share the lessons learned from our evaluation of EasyBuild, which facilitates formulation and sharing of build recipes.

            An Overview of the IHK/McKernel Multi-kernel Operating System
        </h4>

        <em>By</em> Balazs Gerofi, RIKEN Advanced Institute For Computational Science

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computation Science is in charge of leading the development of Japan's next generation flagship supercomputer, the successor of the K. Part of this effort is to design and develop a system software stack that suits the needs of future extreme scale computing. In this talk, we focus on operating system (OS) requirements for HPC and discuss IHK/McKernel, a multi-kernel based operating system framework. IHK/McKernel runs Linux with a light-weight kernel (LWK) side-by-side on compute nodes with the primary motivation of providing scalable, consistent performance for large scale HPC simulations, but at the same time to retain a fully Linux compatible execution environment. We provide an overview of the project and discuss the status of its support for ARM architecture.

            Compilation of COSMO for GPU using LLVM
        </h4>

        <em>By</em> Tobias Grosser, Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory (SPCL)

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            The COSMO climate and weather model delivers daily forecasts for
            Switzerland and many other nations. As a traditional HPC application it
            was developed with SIMD-CPUs in mind and large manual efforts were
            required to enable the 2016 move to GPU acceleration. As today's high-performance computer systems increasingly rely on accelerators to
            reach peak performance and manual translation to accelerators is both
            costly and difficult to maintain, we propose a fully automatic
            accelerator compiler for the automatic translation of scientific Fortran
            codes to CUDA GPU accelerated systems. Several challenges had to be
            overcome to make this reality: 1) improved scalability, 2) automatic
            data placement using unified memory, 3) loop rescheduling to expose
            coarse-grained parallelism, 4) inter-procedural loop optimization, and
            5) plenty of performance tuning. Our evaluation shows that end-to-end
            automatic accelerator compilation is possible for non-trivial portions
            of the COSMO climate model, despite the lack of complete static
            information. Non-trivial loop optimizations previously implemented
            manually are performed fully automatically and memory management happens
            fully transparently using unified memory. Our preliminary results show
            notable performance improvements over sequential CPU code  (40s to 8s
            reduction in execution time) and we are currently working on closing the
            remaining gap to hand-tuned GPU code. This talk is a status update on
            our most recent efforts and also intended to gather feedback on future
            research plans towards automatically mapping COSMO to FPGAs.

        <p>
            Tobias Grosser is a senior researcher in the Scalable Parallel Computing
            Laboratory (SPCL)  of Torsten Hoefler at the Computer Science Department
            of ETH Zürich. Supported by a Google PhD Fellowship he received his
            doctoral degree from Universite Pierre et Marie Curie under the
            supervision of Albert Cohen. Tobias' research is taking place at the
            border of low-level compilers and high-level program transformations
            with the goal of enabling complex - but highly-beneficial - program
            transformations in a production compiler environment. He develops with
            the Polly loop optimizer a loop transformation framework which today is
            a community project supported throught the Polly Labs research
            laboratory. Tobias also developed advanced tiling schemes for the
            efficient execution of iterated stencils. Today Tobias leads the
            heterogeneous compute efforts in the Swiss University funded ComPASC
            project and is about to start a three year NSF Ambizione project on
            advancing automatic compilation and heterogenization techniques at ETH

            Cyber-physical System and Industrial Applications of Large-Scale Graph Analysis and Optimization Problem
        </h4>

        <em>By</em> Katsuki Fujisawa, The Institute of Mathematics for Industry, Kyushu University & The Artificial Intelligence Research Center, Advanced Industrial Science and Technology)

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            In this talk, we present our ongoing research project. The objective of many ongoing research projects in high performance computing (HPC) areas is to develop an advanced computing and optimization infrastructure for extremely large-scale graphs on the peta-scale supercomputers. The extremely large-scale graphs that have recently emerged in various application fields, such as transportation, social networks, cyber-security, and bioinformatics, require fast and scalable analysis. The number of vertices in the graph networks has grown from billions to trillions and that of the edges from hundreds of billions to tens of trillions. The Graph500 (http://graph500.org) and Green Graph 500 (http://green.graph500.org) benchmarks are designed to measure the performance of a computer system for applications that require irregular memory and network access patterns. Following its announcement in June 2010, the Graph500 list was released in November 2010, since when it has been updated semiannually. The Graph500 benchmark measures the performance of any supercomputer performing a breadth-first search (BFS) in terms of traversed edges per second (TEPS). In 2014 to 2017, our project team has been a winner at the eighth, and 10th to 15th Graph500 benchmark. We commenced our research project for developing the Urban OS (Operating System) for a large-scale city in 2013. The Urban OS, which is regarded as one of the emerging applications of the cyber-physical system (CPS), gathers big data sets of the distribution of people and transportation movements by utilizing sensor technologies and storing them in the cloud storage system. In the next step, we apply optimization and simulation techniques to solve them and check the validity of solutions obtained on the cyber space. The Urban OS employs the graph analysis system developed by this research project and provides a feedback to a predicting and controlling center to optimize many social systems and services. We briefly explain our ongoing research project for realizing the Urban OS.

            New Process/Thread Runtime
        </h4>

        <em>By</em> Atsushi Hori, RIKEN

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            New portable and practical parallel execution model, Process in Process (PiP in short) will be presented. PiP tasks share the same virtual address space like the multi-thread model and privatized variables like the multi-process model. Because of this, PiP provides the best of two worlds, multi-process (MPI) and multi-thread (OpenMP).

            OpenMP Extension for Explicit SIMD Programming using ARM SVE
        </h4>

        <em>By</em> Jinpil Lee, RIKEN AICS

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            Recent trends in processor design accommodate wide vector extensions. SIMD vectorization is more important than before to exploit the potential performance of the target architecture. The latest OpenMP specification provides new directives which help compilers produce better code for SIMD auto-vectorization. However, it is hard to optimize the SIMD code performance in OpenMP since the target SIMD code generation mostly relies on the compiler implementation. In this research, we propose a new directive that specifies user-defined SIMD variants of functions used in SIMD loops. The compiler can then use the user-defined SIMD variants when it encounters OpenMP loops instead of auto-vectorized SIMD variants. The user can optimize the SIMD performance by implementing highly-optimized SIMD code with intrinsic functions.

        <p class="talk-abstract">
            The "co-design" is a bi-directional approach where a system would be designed on demand from applications and the applications must be optimized to the system. The performance estimation and evaluation of applications are important for the co-design. In this talk, we focus on the performance evaluation with Arm HPC tools for SVE.
