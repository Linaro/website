**Session Name:** BUD17-201 – ARM Server Standards: The Next Generation – BUD17-201

**Abstract:**
We have recently achieved a critical milestone of having core enablement for SBSA (Server Base System Architecture) and SBBR (Server Base Boot Requirements) in upstream kernels “out of the box”. These initial standards address minimal functionality and will soon undergo additional development as we seek to cover more complex use case requirements, such as NFV, and those introduced by the emergence of workload acceleration (CCIX, FPGAs, etc.). In this session, we will gather feedback and input on where to go next.

**Session Name:** Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) on ARM64 – BUD17-209

**Abstract:**
The RAS architecture base on RAS extension, SDEI, APEI.

1. the definition, Function and importance of RAS

2. Hardware requirement： CPU, GIC and RAS Extension

3. Firmware support : SDEI dispatcher and APEI support, and how to take advantage of RAS Extension.

4. OS support: APEI driver and SDEI client, error report mechanism(trace event)

5. Userspace recorder: rasdaemon

**Session Name:** Libvirt integration and testing for enterprise KVM/ARM – BUD17-213

**Abstract:**
This technical discussion will highlight on-going Red Hat activities for the integration of an Enterprise Virtualization stack and present a vision of an enterprise guest. The status of features such as live migration, device assignment, H52PCIe topology, large guest support, and more will be presented. The status will cover the integration up to the libvirt level of the stack, and exhibit that components above libvirt can “”just work””, even when development, to this time, has been predominately focused on other architectures. As feature parity with x86 is a goal, the remaining gaps with x86 wil also be highlighted. Finally, the status of the verification efforts, specifically those involving the Avocado and kvm-unit-tests frameworks, will be presented.

**Speakers:** Drew Jones, Eric Auger

**Session Name:** DynInst on arm64 – Status – BUD17-323

**Abstract:**
The DynInst package (https://github.com/dyninst/dyninst) provides an API for program binary analysis and instrumentation. In this technical session, after a brief general introduction of the package itself, the recent arm64 porting work and the bug fixes needed to make the package work on a recent upstream kernel with the binary utilities will be explained in detail. The talk will conclude explaining the key features currently missing on arm64, namely code generation and relocation, to be implemented in 2017.
