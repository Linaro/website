The third day of Linaro Connect Budapest 2017 (BUD17) had a theme of networking and the two morning keynotes were right on point for this topic. The first keynote of the day was by Björn Ekelund, who is Head of Hardware and Device Technology at Ericsson Research. Mr. Ekelund's keynote was titled: Human communication, a niche use case in 5G. He spoke about how the fifth generation mobile communications network is optimized for connected and intelligent machines. To watch his keynote please visit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmHrMa7Hq68 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmHrMa7Hq68)

The second keynote of the morning was by David Abdurachmanov, who is part of Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, and Jakob Blomer, a computer scientist in the scientific software group at CERN in Geneva. They gave a keynote titled: High Energy Physics and ARMv8 64-bit? Investigating The Future of Computing at CERN. Their talk contained information about future (a timeline of 10 years) computation needs for LHC experiments and the more recent progress done by ATLAS, CernVM and CMS teams on using ARMv8 64-bit/AArch64.

Linaro Connects are about collaboration and learning but they are also about socializing. In addition to the traditional breaks in the day and informal hacking sessions held each day there are also many evening events that allow attendees to network with their peers and get to know the other attendees as well as experience some of the local culture.  On Tuesday evening there was an event at the Opera Cafe in Budapest where attendees were treated to a great performance.

Below is a list of the keynotes and sessions that took place on Wednesday along with links to the materials that are available. Keep checking back to the Linaro Connect resources page as we will continue to update it as more materials become available: [http://connect.linaro.org/resources/](/resources/)
