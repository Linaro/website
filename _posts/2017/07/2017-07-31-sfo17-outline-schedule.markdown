Linaro Connect begins on Monday September 25th and finishes on Friday September 29th. Monday through Thursday we will kick off the day with opening remarks followed by a keynote, sessions and BoFs (Birds of Feather), lunch for all attendees, followed by more sessions, BoFs and team engineering/meetings in the afternoon. On Friday we will hold a panel instead of a keynote, followed by sessions and then our usual Demo Friday showcase will begin at noon.
