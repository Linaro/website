Here are a couple of security highlights from last month's Linaro Connect SFO17.

**SFO17-309 - Secure Storage Updates**
"The last release of OP-TEE includes big updates to secure storage. Integrity protection is improved and the entire secure storage space is saved as one snapshot on each update." [video/slides](http://connect.linaro.org/resource/sfo17/sfo17-309/)

Speakers: Jens Wiklander, Jerome Forissier


**SFO17-201 - Secure Boot on ARM systems**

*Building a complete Chain of Trust upon existing industry standards using open-source firmware*
"This presentation describes how this goal can be achieved on ARM systems from the very first firmware executed at power-on up to the Operating System execution by combining ARM Trusted Firmware with EDK2, two reference open-source implementations of the ARM Trusted Board Boot Requirement and UEFI Secure Boot specifications respectively." [video/slides](http://connect.linaro.org/resource/sfo17/sfo17-201/)
