                    <blockquote>
                        A little less than a year ago I began my internship with Linaro. This internship was the last
                        thing I had to do before graduating, and those six months were the time where I learned
                        the most about Software Engineering, Machine Architectures and
                        Infrastructure. Linaro's employees' expertise is renowned all over
                        the Arm world, and by working with them, one cannot help but
                        gain more knowledge, understanding and experience.
                        With my internship over, so was my Masters Degree, and
                        I had the immense pleasure of having a full-time position
                        as an Engineer proposed to me. As soon as my university
                        allowed, I started working full-time on multiple and
                        various projects, which I had the privilege to have
                        some influence on. Solving bugs, adding new
                        features and driving the projects forward is my
                        every day routine, and I love it !

                        A year and a half ago, I was an intern at Linaro as a
                        Marketing and Events Assistant. Once my internship
                        was over, my Manager told me that she would be
                        happy for me to come back after graduating.
                        I returned to university and 6 months later
                        I was back in Linaro for my second internship.
                        I have now been a Linaro employee since
                        last August as an Events and Social Media
                        Coordinator and I am really pleased to
                        be part of the team.

                        <blockquote>
                        A year ago, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Linaro. Through my internship I was
                        able to find a practical application for the theory I had been learning at University.
                        During my time as an Intern I created a facial recognition demo, and
                        by the end of my internship I discovered the huge satisfaction of
                        developing and completing a project. As I didn't have a
                        background in Neural Networks at the time, I realised the joy
                        of learning and diving deep into a topic on my own instead of
                        following a lecturers lesson plan. More recently I started as
                        a Software Engineer full-time at Linaro after finishing
                        university in may. As a member of the 96Boards team
                        in Linaro I've had the opportunity to work in many
                        topics which interest me, such as self driving cars and
                        neural networks which has been very fulfilling.
