## What is a Landing Team?

A Landing Team is a team of software engineers composed of engineers from both Linaro and a Member company. Unlike the Working Groups, the Landing Team is directed by and delivers to a single Member company. Linaro provides one or two software engineers and a project manager. One of the Linaro engineers is the team lead. The remaining Linaro and Member software engineers are selected so they have the skill sets required to deliver on the set of tasks the team undertakes for the Member. Landing Teams are available to Club and Core Members.

This team focuses on a set of tasks that the Member and Linaro agree to undertake jointly. Privacy is the key differential between a Landing Team and a Working Group. Landing Team work is private to the Member. The work in a Working Group is visible to all Members agreed upon jointly by Linaro’s Technical Steering Committee (TSC). The Linaro members of the Landing Team operate under a mutual non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the Member for the purpose of safeguarding the confidentiality of the Member’s confidential information. The Linaro Member Landing Team personnel provided by Linaro only consist of Linaro employees or contractors.

A Landing Team is also expected to interact with the Member’s internal teams on an informal basis, allowing them to highlight work the team or Linaro Working Groups do that is of interest to those internal teams. This helps the Member’s teams track what is being done inside Linaro, and whether that work should be used in a Member’s product.

## What kind of tasks can a Landing Team undertake?

Within the framework of Linaro’s mission, the Landing Team will perform useful work that is valued by the Member. In broad terms, a Landing Team’s mission usually supports Linaro’s shared engineering objectives, helping the member work successfully with open source communities or aiding in bringing new ARM technology to market. A Landing Team is not an outsource or 3rd party contracting vehicle.

For example, Working Groups require a mainline kernel on a Member board to complete or test new functionality. To support this, Landing Teams have forward ported a number of Member’s BSP kernels to mainline kernel versions, completed board bringup on new evaluation boards, and provided the enablement bits required for monthly Linaro engineering builds.

Landing Teams also provide advice and instruction to internal Member engineers to help them to work effectively with upstream communities and upstream their ports of the Linux kernel and U-boot. In some cases, this includes setting up a mailing list to teach Member engineers how to work with the upstream Linux kernel community. This mailing list can provide the review of patches and messages to maintainers in a much more forgiving atmosphere than is generally privided by the upstream mailing lists. This activity helps build the skill for upstreaming work inside the Member’s engineering organization.

Landing Teams also track the latest ARM technology and the work of the Linaro Working Groups. They feed back information to their contacts on the Member’s internal engineering teams, and have provided presentations on new topics such as the In-Kernel Switcher and big.LITTLE GTS patchset. Landing Teams can also help arrange subject matter experts and maintainers in Linaro’s Working groups to present to the Member’s internal engineering teams.
