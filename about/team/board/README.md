The Board is the principal decision making body and focuses on ensuring the organization is moving toward its strategic mission through a combination of industry positioning, key partnerships, membership, and funding.

To maintain separation between long term objectives and nearer term development roadmaps, the Board looks to the Executive team and the Technical Steering Committee to apply development resources to projects based on the needs of members. The Board is made up of appointed individuals from each Core Member, a Club director representing the interests of all Club members and the CEO. More details can be found in the [Company’s Articles of Association](/assets/downloads/Linaro-Articles-of-Association-New-June-2010.pdf) and [Rules of Membership](/assets/downloads/Membership_Rules_of_Linaro_Limited_Effective_26th_July_20122.pdf).
