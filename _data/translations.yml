  value_1: Collaborate on developing standards which allow you to differentiate
  desc_1: Linaro was formed in 2010 to address the lack of standardization on foundational Arm software. Everyone was creating their own foundational software which was then only applicable to their platforms, resulting in extra engineering effort to make it applicable to other platforms. Linaro, together with other companies working on Arm-based technology, joined forces to create standards for kernel, toolchain and security. We solved the problems we set out to fix but as new technology continues to appear, there will always be a need for standardization to reduce engineering effort and thereby accelerate innovation.
  quote_1: Linaro is the collaboration platform for the Arm partnership. Where everyone comes together to collaborate on open source software, where conversations take place and non-differentiating solutions are discussed and worked upon.
  value_2: Leverage Linaro’s Arm Software expertise and connection with Open Source Communities
  desc_2: Linaro employs some of the world’s leading Arm software experts, with more than 60 software kernel maintainers looking after more than 100 open source projects. Since our inception, we have been continually ranked by LWN.net in the top ten companies which contribute to the Linux kernel - no small feat for a company with 250 engineers! We are able to successfully and efficiently deliver standardized solutions for the Arm software ecosystem because our team of Engineers are highly experienced and well connected to the Open Source Community.
  quote_2: In order to become part of the open source community, I felt it was important to join our peers. I believe we benefited greatly from joining Linaro since we now have a connection with various communities including Linaro and the Linux Community.
  value_3: Reduce costs on development by sharing engineering resource
  desc_3: Once needs have been identified and strategy agreed upon, Linaro engineers work with member engineers and the open source community to deliver the solutions. Sharing engineering resource significantly reduces overall development costs and helps accelerate time to market as more engineers - with different perspectives - are able to dedicate time to building software, problem solving and troubleshooting.
  quote_3: Linaro are like the all-star team of open source technology in many ways. This is a group of highly experienced experts that know what they’re doing. We learn a lot by being members of Linaro that we wouldn’t be able to learn in any other community.

  quote1: Linaro Developer Services provide deep Arm technical knowledge as well as strong relationships within various upstream communities. Their engagement in the latest Arm technologies allows for quick and solid deliverables, helping to de-risk a program. They have helped enable an Arm-based Windows laptop to support Linux, developed a variety of Docker containers for Arm-based servers, and also enabled firmware secure boot capabilities on an NXP-based system. If you need help with Arm firmware or software development, Linaro brings that professional edge.
  quote2a: At Square, we face the challenge of maintaining our Terminal and Register hardware products, which are based on short-support-cycle mobile technology, in an industry that requires long lifespans and up-to-date security patching. After the Qualcomm SD615 processor (2014) powering our devices went end-of-life in 2018, Square chose to engage with the Arm Linux specialists at Linaro for upstream-based extended life. Having seen their previous work on the DragonBoard 410c, we were confident that upstreaming was the right path and Linaro was the right partner to deliver a new Linux kernel paired with an up-to-date Android release.
  quote2b: The team dispatched from Linaro Developer Services was highly experienced in how to accomplish this without compromising on productization-level stability, battery life, or performance. As a result of this collaboration, Square is able to continue providing regular OS and kernel upgrades to our Terminal and Register customers for 5-10 more years. In particular, Linaro's expertise and assistance in bringing SoCs and boards into mainline ensures upstream support doesn't decay over time & provides a platform for the community to continue contributing to and benefiting from the work, reducing long term software burden.
