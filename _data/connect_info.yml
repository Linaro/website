      events are working conferences intended for professional networking and
      collaboration in the Linux community. They exist to encourage the open
      exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that
      recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. While at Linaro
      events or related ancillary or social events, any participants, including
      speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors, booth staff and
      anyone else, should not engage in harassment in any form of communication
      or media including email, texting and social media.


      All event participants are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both the Linaro Connect Code of Conduct as well as their respective employer's policies governing appropriate workplace behavior, and applicable laws.

Harassment includes the use of abusive, offensive or degrading language, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors.. Any report of harassment at one of our events will be addressed immediately. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone who witnesses or is subjected to unacceptable behavior should notify a conference organizer at once.


      Exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material in their booths and must refrain from the use of sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise creating a sexualized environment. Speakers should not use sexual language, images, or any language or images that would constitute harassment as defined above in their talks.


      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from issuance of a warning to the offending individual to expulsion from the conference with no refund, depending on the circumstances. Linaro reserves the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing behavior from participating in any further Linaro events, trainings or other activities.
