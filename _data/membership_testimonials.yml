      The collaboration platform for the Arm partnership. Where everyone comes
      together to collaborate on open source software, where conversations take
      place and non-differentiating solutions are discussed and worked upon.

      One thing I like about Linaro specifically is that it is comprised of very
      senior experts in the field, almost like the all star team of Open Source
      Technology in many ways. This is a group of highly experienced experts
      that know what they’re doing and we learn a lot by being part of Linaro
      that we wouldn’t be able to learn in any other community.

      In order to become part of the open source community, I felt it was very
      important to join our peers. I believe we benefited greatly from joining
      Linaro since we now have a connection with various communities including
      Linaro and the Linux Community.
