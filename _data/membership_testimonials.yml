        The collaboration platform for the Arm
        partnership. Where everyone comes
        together to collaborate on open source
        software, where conversations take place
        and non-differentiating solutions are
        discussed and worked upon.

        One thing I like about Linaro specifically is that it is comprised of very senior experts in the field, almost like the all star team of Open Source Technology in many ways. This is a group of highly experienced experts that know what they’re doing and we learn a lot by being part of Linaro that we wouldn’t be able to learn in any other community.

        One thing that is unique about Linaro is the breadth of worldwide companies that are in it. I don’t think we get as diverse of a group in any of the other organisations that I am in.

        All members are focused around the Arm infrastructure and architecture. As a result, we are all looking for common optimisations and common environments to build on, regardless of whether we're targeting a server, networking or edge device.

        In order to become part of the open source community, I felt it was very important to join our peers. I believe we benefited greatly from joining Linaro since we now have a connection with various communities including Linaro and the Linux Community.
