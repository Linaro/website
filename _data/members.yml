    Group members have a vote on their group steering committee and an elected representative on the TSC. Group membership is a good way for companies with a focus in a particular segment to get involved and influence the direction of Linaro’s work in that segment. There are currently five segment groups at Linaro: [Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG)](#leg), [Linaro Home Group (LHG)](#lhg), [Linaro Mobile Group (LMG)](#lmg), [Linaro Networking Group (LNG)](#lng) and our newest group – [Linaro Community Board Group (LCG)](https://www.96boards.org). Below are the lists of the members of each respective group.

      LEDGE will initially focus on industrial use cases with major contributions in TSN technologies into the Linux kernel. It will produce an OpenEmbedded derived Reference Platform comprising a minimal set of building blocks. An end-to-end Continuous Integration process will be established with an additional set of libraries and payload  to prove the feature completeness Reference Platform.

      The Machine Intelligence initiative at Linaro aims at collaborating to reduce fragmentation in the Deep learning NN acceleration ecosystem, where currently every IP vendor forks the existing open source models and frameworks to integrate their hardware blocks and then tune for performance. This leads to a duplication of effort amongst all players, perpetual cost of re-integration for every new rebasing, and overall increased total cost of ownership.

      The Linaro High Performance Compute SIG (LHPS) was launched at Linaro Connect LAS16 in September 2016. 
      
      The HPC SIG is directed by a steering committee that is comprised of representatives from member companies who determine the technical agenda for the group. There is  also an Advisory Board who provide subject matter expertise and guidance as users.  HPC will benefit from Linaro’s other engineering activities in the same way as Linaro’s  other groups do. All groups rely on core engineering work (for example, Toolchain (GCC, LLVM) and Virtualisation (QEMU) and influence the roadmap of these common, shared projects. HPC will also leverage Linaro’s work on the Enterprise Reference Platform and boot architecture from the Linaro Datacenter & Cloud Group (LDCG). 
      
      Companies interested in working together on driving the adoption of Arm in HPC through standardisation, interoperability, orchestration and use case development are invited to contact Linaro with the form below.

      The purpose of the Linaro Datacenter & Cloud Group (LDCG) is to collaborate and accelerate the development of foundational open source software for Arm Server. LDCG benefits have broad industry implications, including time to market acceleration, lower development costs, and access to innovative and differentiated systems, fundamental to the Arm ecosystem.  Originally established in November 2012 as the Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG) it has evolved with the introduction of new technologies and hardware.
