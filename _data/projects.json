It can be used in conjunction with storage and network encryption, which protect data at rest and data in transit respectively.<br><br>The technology protects data in use by performing computations in a hardware-base trusted execution environment (TEE). Even though the ideas behind confidential computing are not necessarily new, with the Arm TrustZone being a good example of a confidential computing environment that is available for quite some time, there has been recently a race amongst chip providers to allow full fledged operating systems to run in trusted execution environments.<br><br>Arm\u2019s solution for this is specified in the <a href=\"https://www.arm.com/architecture/security-features/arm-confidential-compute-architecture\">Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA)</a>. The trusted execution environments capable of running full fledged operating systems, also known as confidential virtual machines, are called Realms in this specification. The specification describes what is needed to be enabled in the hardware to run Realms, through the Realm Management Extension (RME). It also describes changes needed in the firmware, both in Trusted Firmware-A and in the newly introduced Real Management Monitor (RMM), along with other changes needed in the system software level to properly run Realms.<br><br>The Arm\u2019s specification is focused on hardware and system software. It does not cover the user level tools that are being used to build, configure, run, and manage confidential virtual machines and their workloads. This is, however, also an important aspect of the Confidential Computing ecosystem.<br><br>Hence, this project will work to make sure that both the lower level bits, as well as the user space and higher level applications, work well on Arm platforms. The scope, however, is limited to confidential VMs, or Realms as they are called in the Arm ecosystem. We will not focus efforts, in this project, on the TEEs that are also available through the TrustZone technology on Arm processors.",

However, the SCMI perf-domain protocol isn't really limited to CPUs, but fits well for other generic peripheral devices too. Extended support avoids the need for SoC specific protocols/interfaces, while scaling performance for non-CPU devices.<br><br>The Linux kernel already has generic support for DVFS (Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling), through a mixture of subsystems/libraries. Without going into details, it should be possible to tap into the existing infrastructures, to add support for the SCMI perf-protocol. In this way, the support would be generic and nicely abstracted from lower layer drivers/subsystems.",
