Mobile Phone world has been one of the most active contributors in this area with the aim to run always more powerful systems on always more constrained batteries. In fact,  most of systems can\u2019t afford to simply put everything to its maximum performance level but has to follow either a thermal budget or a maximum power budget.  In this way, large systems also have to deal with those constraints in order to use their power budget efficiently and reach maximum performances. This project aims to improve the efficiency of all ARM based Linux systems, small or large, by improving Linux subsystems that influence its performance or power consumption, which includes the scheduler or the thermal framework in addition to the traditional power management subsystems.",

That includes the application processor (AP)  on which we can have both rich OS like Linux but also a TEE like OP-TEE.<br>Each client of the power coprocessor has its own access point with specific control permissions on the power resources. But on some \u201cmedium/small\u201d systems, the power coprocessor may not be present or doesn\u2019t provide enough access points. In such a case, the AP itself has to control and filter the access to the power resources.<br>For security reason, the TEE must have the control of shared resources and populate the authorized resources to the non secure world. The TEE acts as a power coprocessor from Linux PoV and we can keep the SCMI interface.",
