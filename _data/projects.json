Mobile Phone world has been one of the most active contributors in this area with the aim to run always more powerful systems on always more constrained batteries. In fact,  most of systems can\u2019t afford to simply put everything to its maximum performance level but has to follow either a thermal budget or a maximum power budget.  In this way, large systems also have to deal with those constraints in order to use their power budget efficiently and reach maximum performances. This project aims to improve the efficiency of all ARM based Linux systems, small or large, by improving Linux subsystems that influence its performance or power consumption, which includes the scheduler or the thermal framework in addition to the traditional power management subsystems.",

Given the time required to go from early bringup to shipping a product, the kernel supported by the form factor devices are always one and a half to two years old by the time they ship. This means these devices have little value for testing the current upstream kernel, and each device is really only useful for testing updates to the -stable kernel release it shipped with. This makes them less than ideal for developing any functionality that can be pushed upstream into the mainline kernel.\u00a0<br><br>Additionally, because the form-factor devices are enclosed, there is little ability to prototype hardware that didn\u2019t ship on the device.\u00a0<br><br>Hardware with a well implemented software stack integrated into AOSP is able to solve both of these issues, as we prioritize devices that are close to upstream and continually push to upstream any board specific patches needed, so we are able to always move forward to newer kernels and continue to support a wide array of stable kernels.\u00a0<br><br>This allows us to quickly find and report regressions that come up in the mainline or -stable branches that might affect Android/AOSP.<br><br>Also hardware in the form of developer boards (devboards) are useful platforms for developing new functionality. The DMABUF Heaps interface, which replaces ION in future kernels, was prototyped and validated on the AOSP devboards, allowing us to confidently know that the patches we were submitting upstream would work well with Android. Additionally, initial prototyping of Google\u2019s GKI effort was done on AOSP devboards, in order to work out issues and to minimize issues that vendors might run into and slow product shipping. Google developers have also used these boards to validate changes such as filesystem and UFS crypto changes that they were pushing upstream.\u00a0 This is much better than having to develop in Android against an older device kernel and then forward porting the patch to the latest upstream kernel and, having no other way to validate it, hoping it works properly when it makes it upstream.<br><br>Since the devboards have a wider array of expansion ports that often can be used to prototype and validate new hardware designs that are targeting Android, making it easier for vendors to validate their kernel drivers and Android HALs against the latest mainline kernels and AOSP userland.",
