Mobile Phone world has been one of the most active contributors in this area with the aim to run always more powerful systems on always more constrained batteries. In fact,  most of systems can\u2019t afford to simply put everything to its maximum performance level but has to follow either a thermal budget or a maximum power budget.  In this way, large systems also have to deal with those constraints in order to use their power budget efficiently and reach maximum performances. This project aims to improve the efficiency of all ARM based Linux systems, small or large, by improving Linux subsystems that influence its performance or power consumption, which includes the scheduler or the thermal framework in addition to the traditional power management subsystems.",
