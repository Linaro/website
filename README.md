- [Building the static site](#building-the-static-site)

## Adding a blog post

In order to add a blog post to Linaro.org copy an existing post from the [_posts folder](https://github.com/Linaro/website/tree/master/_posts). Posts are organised into by year/month so add to the correct folder based on the month you are posting it in and if the folder doesn't exist create one.

### Step 1 - Modify the post file name
The url for your post is based on the title provided in the filename e.g 2018-06-07-announcing-women-in-stem.md will have a url of /blog/announcing-women-in-stem/. Separate the words in your title by dashes and modify the date at the start of the filename as neccessary. 

### Step 2 - Modify the post front matter

Modify the post front matter based on your post. Values to modify are:
- author:
- date:
- image:
- tags:
- description:
- categories: 

#### Author

Change the author to a unique author username (e.g firstname.surname). If this is your first time posting then add your author information to the [_authors](https://github.com/Linaro/website/blob/master/_authors) collection by duplicating an existing author's .md file and modifying the values appropiately. Make sure to add your profile image to the [/assets/images/authors folder](https://github.com/Linaro/website/tree/master/assets/images/authors). Verify that the author "username:" in the _authors/ collection file for your author is an exact match to that provided as the author: in your post. Doing the above will ensure your author image and pages are rendered correctly on the Linaro.org website.

#### Date
Modify the date to sometime before you post the blog otherwise Jekyll will see it as a __future__ post and not render it until the time on the server exceeds/equals that provided as the date in the post front matter.

#### Image

This value is used for the featured image displayed on your blog post and the image that is used when sharing the blog post on social media sites.

```YAML

image:
    featured: true
    path: /assets/images/blog/image-name.png
    name: image-name.png
    thumb: image-name.png 
    
```

Make sure that the image you add in this section of front matter is placed in the [/assets/images/blog folder](https://github.com/linaro/website/tree/master/assets/images/blog).

#### Tags
These should be modified based on the content of your post as they are used for Meta keywords so that people can find your post based on the [tags your provide](https://www.96boards.org/blog/tag/).

#### Description
Change this value to a short description of your blog post as this is used as the meta description of your blog post.

#### Categories
There are two categories to choose from:
- News
- blog

Set one or the other in the front matter of your post. If you add the "blog" category your post will show under [/blog/](https://www.linaro.org/blog/) whereas if you add the "News" category your post will display under the [/news/](https://www.linaro.org/news/) section.

### Step 3 - Add your post content.

Write your post content in Markdown format; specifically the [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) Markdown flavour.

#### Adding images
Please use the following code snipppet to add an image to your blog post. Make sure to add the images that you include to [/assets/images/blog folder](https://github.com/linaro/website/tree/master/assets/images/blog).

```
{% include image.html name="name-of-your-image.png" alt="The Alt text for your image" %}
```

You also align/scale your image using the following css classes.

|Class|Details|
|-----|-------|
|small-inline|Small image aligned to the left|
|small-inline right| Small image aligned to the right|
|medium-inline|Medium image aligned to the left|
|medium-inline right|Medium image aligned to the right|
|large-inline|Large image aligned to the left|
|large-inline right|Large image aligned to the right|

```
{% include image.html name="name-of-your-image.png"  class="medium-inline" alt="The Alt text for your image" %}
```

Using this Jekyll include will allow your images to be lazy loaded and format the image HTML correctly.


#### Adding code

We are using the rouge syntax highlighter to highlight your glorious code. 

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --port 1337
```

See the full list of languages [here](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).


#### Adding Media/YouTube videos

To add a media element / YouTube video use the following Jekyll include.

```
{% include media.html media_url="https://youtu.be/GFzJd0hXI0c" %}
```

## Building the static site

In order to build the Linaro.org static site make sure you have Ruby and the bundler/jekyll gems installed. For instructions on how to setup an environment to build Jekyll sites see the official Jekyll documentation [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once you have above installed you can simply clone this repo and run the following:

```
$ bundle 
```

This will install the required gems listed in the Gemfile.

```
$ bundle exec jekyll s 
```

This will serve (s) the Jekyll static website to the http://localhost:4000 where you can view the generated static website.
