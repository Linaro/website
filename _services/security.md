            Linaro is a contributor to each of these projects. In addition, the
            Linaro Community Projects Division hosts the [Trusted Firmware

            project](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/) and the [MCUboot project](https://www.mcuboot.com/).


            We have direct experience using these projects to deliver optimized trusted boot solutions to a number of customers; on Arm

            servers, set top boxes, embedded/IoT systems and in server BMC environments using OpenBMC.


            We have worked with customers to implement challenging product boot performance requirements. Such work often involved

            profiling and characterizing system boot performance, determining those areas that affect boot performance, developing a

            solution to boost the boot performance and the implementation and validation of the solution to ensure the performance meets

            the requirements for the system.

            Linaro Developer Services are also able to confidently design and
            deliver secure boot solutions that meet SystemReady and PSA

            Level 1 certifications. We have worked with Arm to extend the work of Linaro’s Edge and Fog Computing group (LEDGE) on the
            [Trusted substrate project](/trusted-substrate/) to develop and upstream a SystemReady IR secure boot solution on NXP chipsets that have been
            adopted by NXP as part of their product BSP.


            We also maintain SystemReady IR, ES and SR solutions for the Socionext DeveloperBox.

            OP-TEE is a secure OS that is easily portable, provides a small
            footprint, and leverages [Arm®
            TrustZone®](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/security-ip/trustzone)
            technology to provide

            isolation from the normal world. OP-TEE is GlobalPlatform TEE System Architecture specification compliant.


            Linaro has extensive experience with the Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment (OP-TEE). The core maintainers for the

            OP-TEE project, as well as the maintainers for the TEE framework in the Linux kernel and U-Boot are employed by Linaro.


            Trusted Services is a Trusted Firmware project implementing a secure partition manager, and a number of trusted services that

            run in secure partitions within OP-TEE.


            Linaro Developer Services has experience porting and enhancing OP-TEE on various SoCs, as well as using the Arm Trusted

            Services project to implement a PSA root of trust (RoT) to obtain PSA level 1 certification for an NXP based platform.
