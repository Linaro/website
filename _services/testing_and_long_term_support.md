            We specialise in rapid deployment of automated testing and have created (and
            maintain) projects such as LAVA (Linaro’s Automated Validation Architecture) and
            LKFT (Linaro’s Kernel Functional Test) to help maintain the quality of the kernel.

            In addition to our expertise in Linux testing, we are known for our strong track record
            in kernel engineering. Linaro has been ranked in the top ten contributors to each
            release of the Linux kernel, both in terms of companies and employees for many years
            now.

            All of this expertise is available to you through Linaro Developer Services.
