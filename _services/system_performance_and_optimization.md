            Porting your software to run efficiently on Arm-based systems is more than just recompiling
            your code. Code will need optimising to be performant - both the high-level software and
            underlying systems libraries and tools.

            Linaro has world class engineers with a deep understanding of all profiles and
            versions of the Arm Architecture. This ranges from deeply embedded
            microcontrollers to large HPC-scale machines running in the cloud.

            Linaro Developer Services has specific teams focused on ensuring toolchains (including GCC and LLVM) target Arm-based
            systems effectively. We have significant experience and knowledge of:

            * Tuning toolchains to produce performant code for specific CPU micro-architectures and systems. For the compiler this
            includes optimizations to improve instruction selection, layout, and scheduling. C libraries (e.g. Glibc, Musl-libc, or bionic)
            can be tuned with hand-written assembly routines where appropriate.
            * Tuning toolchains to produce code meeting code-size requirements - in particular for microcontroller environments. This
            includes improving a compilerâ€™s heuristics for instruction selection, function inlining and outlining.
            * Optimizing system libraries for customer workflows. Linaro has worked on system C libraries and other support libraries
            including auto-parallelisation (e.g. OpenMP), Linear Algebra (e.g. OpenBLAS), Machine Learning (e.g. TensorFlow). Work
            includes tuning for the Arm memory model; ensuring that code uses Neon or SVE where appropriate.

            Our strong relationship with toolchain upstream communities facilitates rapid upstreaming and problem resolutions. We
            know how to organise a project and will work with you to ensure your project successfully upstreams code rapidly. We also
            have experience with development in this area for Arm Architecture licensees.

            Linaro Developer Services is able to provide pre-packaged toolchains for your systems that you can ship to your customers
            and partners. In addition to our toolchain packaging services, we can provide you with rapid response to toolchain issues and
            train your developers on how to write developer performant code for the Arm architecture
