            A Board Support Package (BSP) contains essential software a Computer
            hardware device needs to work with the computer's Operating System
            (OS). Whenever the hardware device is switched off, the bootloader
            or boot manager on the BSP will ensure the OS and device drivers are
            placed into memory. 


            BSP's will differ in terms of content depending on the particular hardware device and OS. With this in mind, creating and maintaining a bespoke BSP can be a complicated and labour-intensive undertaking if you don't have the know how. 


            Linaro Developer Services are the Board Support Package (BSP) experts. We have

            extensive engineering experience helping companies with their Linux and/or Android BSP

            development, maintenance, optimisation and long term support. We maintain high

            standards for design, implementation and testing all while following customer

            guidelines and regulatory/compliance specifications as needed.


            Linaro Developer Services can help you develop or maintain:

            Linaro created the 96Boards initiative (which provides a range of hardware

            specifications used by board manufacturers to make the latest Arm based processors

            available to developers at a reasonable cost), and can therefore provide 96Boards

            product development and support.
