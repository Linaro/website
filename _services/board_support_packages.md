            In addition to our Board Support Packages, Linaro’s expertise in

            and toolchain optimization allows us to help you on your project in these areas.


            Linaro created the 96Boards initiative (which provides a range of hardware

            specifications used by board manufacturers to make the latest Arm based processors

            available to developers at a reasonable cost), and can therefore provide 96Boards

            product development and support.
