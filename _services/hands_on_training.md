            While we all know the benefits of working upstream, it can take time
            to understand

            how best to participate and feel confident working directly in open source

            communities. Since 2010, Linaro has driven open source software development on

            Arm. As a result, we are well versed in working with the open source community.

            Linaro Developer Services have expert level knowledge of the wide
            range of open source licenses currently in use in open

            source communities and can provide license audits and recommendations in order to help companies eliminate risk and move to

            compliance. We have deep experience reviewing customer’s code before submission to communities to facilitate faster

            acceptance. Our priority is to ensure companies are benefiting from the best open source has to offer.


            In addition to our role as open source consultants, we also provide advice and hands on Linux training to customers to help them

            significantly improve their working relationship with open source communities and successfully achieve their goals.
