The Machine Intelligence initiative at Linaro aims at collaborating to reduce fragmentation in the Deep learning NN acceleration ecosystem, where currently every IP vendor forks the existing open source models and frameworks to integrate their hardware blocks and then tune for performance. This leads to a duplication of effort amongst all players, perpetual cost of re-integration for every new rebasing, and overall increased total cost of ownership.

The initial focus is on the inference side on Cortex-A application processors with Linux and Android, both edge computing and  smart devices. As part of the remit, the team will collaborate on a definition of API and modular framework for an Arm runtime inference engine architecture based on plug-ins supporting dynamic modules and optimized shared Arm compute libraries.
