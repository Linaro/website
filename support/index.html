### For Linaro members

If your company is a Linaro member, Linaro Developer Technical Support is one of the benefits you get. We are here to
guide and support you on Linaro’s software releases, contributions to open source and training material.  

The scope of support we provide is very  broad, reflecting the many different areas Linaro operates in. Examples of
technologies around which we provide support include GNU and LLVM toolchains for Arm platforms, Linux kernel (including
mainline, Linaro Stable Kernel and kernel testing), power optimization and testing, OP-TEE, QEMU/KVM, LAVA, SQUAD and
any work by your landing team (if your company has one).

To raise an LDTS ticket simply send an e-mail to [support@linaro.org](mailto:support@linaro.org) from your company
e-mail address or, if you prefer, register using your company e-mail address at
[https://support.linaro.org](https://support.linaro.org) . LDTS uses domain names to prioritize tickets from member
companies, if you do not use your company e-mail address then your ticket will not be prioritized correctly.

### For Linaro Developer Services customers

Linaro Developer Technical Support is available to Linaro Developer Services customers at an additional fee as part of
their contract. The scope of cover will vary depending on the contract and Statement of Work with each individual
customer.

If you are unsure as to whether your company has Linaro Developer Technical Support as part of its contract, please
raise a ticket with us nonetheless. We are briefed on the support levels of each customer - if you do not receive
support as part of your contract we will treat your query as a community ticket.

To raise an LDTS ticket simply send an e-mail to [support@linaro.org](mailto:support@linaro.org) from company e-mail
address or, if you prefer, register using your company e-mail address at
[https://support.linaro.org](https://support.linaro.org) . LDTS uses domain names to prioritize tickets from our
customers, if you do not use your company e-mail address then your ticket will not be prioritized correctly.

### For the wider community

As an Open Source consortium, Linaro does not have a commercial product set; rather, we are Member funded for Member
directed projects and efforts for Linux on Arm. Community (non-Member) tickets are therefore handled on a best effort
basis. As a free-of-charge service, the scope is much less broad than the service offered to members and customers and
we are not able to look into unique problems. However where we have information to hand that can help, we will be
delighted to share it.
