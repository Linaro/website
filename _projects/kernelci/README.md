The importance of testing and continuous integration was recognized in the first year of Linaro. A team was established to build [Linaro's Automated Validation Architecture (LAVA)](/engineering/projects/lava/) and the engineering teams have used member hardware, virtual models and cloud services in this framework to test their work from the beginning.

In addition to validating coding with LAVA, the engineers need to integrate their code into upstream repositories, rebuild and check everything works correctly and this needs to happen continuously throughout the day. This process is called Continuous Integration and, between the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014, Linaro developed [KernelCI.org](https://kernelci.org/) to support this. Further information can be found on the site and the [KernelCI wiki page](http://wiki.kernelci.org/).
