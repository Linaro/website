# Open Source Arm Tools

The Toolchain Working Group deals with all aspects of system-level tools – the core development toolchain (compiler, assembler, linker, debugger), emulation, profiling and analysis (oprofile, performance events) and instrumentation (ftrace).

**Key Deliverables:**

- GNU Toolchain Development & Maintainership
   - Monthly Backports and Source Snapshots
   - Quarterly Binary Toolchain Releases
   - Compiler and Library performance improvements
   - Debugging tool improvements
- LLVM Toolchain Development & Maintainership
   - LLVM reference toolchain integration
      - LLVM native libraries and linkers
   - Community Releases and Maintainership
   - LLVM Performance Improvements
   - Debugging Tools Development
- Benchmarking & Analysis of GNU and LLVM Toolchains
   - Release benchmarking
   - Snapshot benchmarking
   - Performance parity benchmarking with other architectures
