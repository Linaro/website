            Linaro Community Projects Division manages open source projects with
            open governance. 


            Open governance provides stakeholders in an open source project with
            transparent mechanisms for managing ecosystem contributions and
            project roadmaps. It gives a project freedom from one companyâ€™s
            ownership and agenda, and this can be critical in driving wide
            adoption of a particular codebase, especially when investment is
            needed by those who want to deploy the code to enable their
            commercial offering. Open governance gives transparent rules about
            how the codebase will evolve and safeguards these investments.


            The Community Projects division was created to allow Linaro-hosted
            open source projects to become open-governance and make them more
            accessible. Linaro felt there needed to be a choice for new,
            cross-architecture, open source, open governance projects. While
            Linaro is a major player in the Arm ecosystem, community projects
            are intended to be cross-architecture.


            The Community Projects Division currently hosts the following
            projects:

            Membership of a particular Community Project is separate from Linaro
            membership and Linaro membership is not required. The project is
            controlled by the project board while Linaro provides legal and
            financial hosting and support.
