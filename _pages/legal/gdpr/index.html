                <p>
                    GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is the name for new data protection legislation that came into effect across the EU (and for any companies who hold information about EU citizens) on the 25th of May 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The legislation impacts all types of website that collect, store, or process information about individuals - whether they are employees, job candidates, employees of our partners, contractors, or anyone else.
