                Together with Arm, Linaro co-maintains the Arm software ecosystem, providing the tools, security and Linux kernel quality needed for a solid base to differentiate on. Enabling markets on Arm architecture since 2010, Linaro works with companies to consolidate Arm code bases in the ecosystem as a whole, as well as in specific market segments. We do this by providing an engineering forum where industry and community can work together on open source software to solve common problems. This collaborative approach reduces software fragmentation across the many Arm platforms and enables industry and community to reduce costs for development and validation of Arm-based software.
