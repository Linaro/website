      bio: >
        Bill’s computing experience began at age 15 when he soldered together his first computer. It had a hex keypad and 256 bytes of memory. Bill maintains that this was the high point of his technical achievement and everything else has been a downward slide.

        Bill is Chief Technologist for Open Source Solutions and Distinguish Member of Technical Staff. Since 2007 Bill has been working to ensure that TI is acting as a member of the open source community. He acts as a representative for TI in various open source communities and advocates for open source concerns and methods within TI.

        Bill has been developing software professionally for over 25 years. Prior to his current position, Bill has a wide variety of experience. Examples include being the system architect for TI’s high density voice gateways and for multiple TI SOCs, technical lead for an in-house real-time executive, and sole developer for a windowed source level debugger for an emulator with trace and hardware break and watch points. In his current position Bill started TI’s open-embedded based Arago-project and is the technical lead for the linux-c6x project that has brought uCLinux to TI’s C6000 DSPs. Bill is a member of the Yocto Project Advisory board.

      bio: >
        David always enjoyed mathematics, but America’s space program together with ‘Star Trek’ made him think that computers were really interesting and so he graduated in 1982 with a degree in Computer Science. At Digital Equipment Corporation he got involved in the port of Linux® to the Alpha processor. This gave him an abiding respect for the power of open source in general and Linux in particular. He worked on StrongArm before moving to Arm where he added tools experience. At Arm he continued to be involved in open source and as a reward for his meddling was made an Arm Fellow. He helped create Linaro, becoming its CTO in 2010.

        When he’s not being a techno-dweeb, David enjoys photography, hiking, cooking, fine wines and friends.

**The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the primary decision-making forum for Linaro development projects. Its purpose is to:**

*   Set the overall direction and technical strategy for Linaro
*   Coordinate strategy across the multiple segment groups, ensuring technical alignment between Linaro members, the core and product engineering teams and Linaro segment groups
*   Oversee engineering activities

The TSC allows members to have a say in the technical direction Linaro should take and the projects Linaro should invest in. All proposals from the engineering teams are reviewed, modified and approved by the TSC, which then advises the Executive Management Team (and through it the Board) on the key technological and operational matters associated with achieving Linaro’s objectives.

The TSC is co-chaired by the CTO and the VP of Engineering and consists of one representative from each Core and Club member and an elected representative for each segment member group.
