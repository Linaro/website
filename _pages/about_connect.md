            Linaro Connect is a developer focused engineering event hosted by Linaro that brings together developers and maintainers of both hardware and software to collaborate and discuss common problems. Topics covered in sessions at Linaro Connect include Linux Kernel, Toolchain, IoT & Embedded, AI, Android, Continuous Integration Testing, Security, Standardized Firmware, and more.

            Since Linaroâ€™s inception in 2010, we have hosted Linaro Connect as a full five day event featuring 120+ technical sessions and keynotes, business meetings, hacking sessions and a Technology demo showcase. At Connect, we have roughly 400 attendees from 25+ countries and 50+ companies in attendance.

            In Spring 2020, we planned to host Linaro Connect in Budapest, Hungary but due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic we had to cancel our in-person event and thus began our journey with virtual events. We hosted our first virtual event [in March 2020](https://resources.linaro.org/en/tags/2014c600-6140-43ee-aa5f-db7fa650bfd5) and have hosted two Linaro Virtual Connect events per year since then.

            Our virtual events have re-created some of the most important elements from Linaro Connect including low level technical session content and training for developers, important industry updates and announcements, technology demos, and the opportunity to hear from and network with other software and hardware developers and open source maintainers. Our goal is to bring together the Arm and open source community globally to collaborate on common problems and our free virtual events have allowed us to involve a wider audience than ever before.

            We will continue to host virtual events moving forward until it is safe to host Linaro Connect again in person. To read more about our plans for upcoming virtual events, check out our blog [here](https://www.linaro.org/blog/reimagining-linaro-virtual-events/).

            We hope we can resume Linaro Connect in person with all of you soon!

            **Session recordings and slides from past Linaro Connects (1400+ free public videos) from our past in-person and virtual Linaro Connect events can be found on [the Linaro Resources Hub](https://resources.linaro.org/)**
