            text: "The IoT Integration Lab is a joint project between Arm and Linaro to create interoperability between vendors creating embedded Linux products. The objective is two fold:


            1. To build up a database of standards compliant and tested SoCs, boards, OSes, and CSP agents that can be used by vendors to certify their products as compliant and can be used in their own product marketing


            2. To be an integration facility for new features as the relevant standards evolve to make sure new requirements are fit for purpose before they are deployed

            
            Participants in the IoT Integration Lab will get first mover advantage by being involved in the development of new features and receiving early notification of any integration problems."
