            providing the tools, Linux kernel quality and security needed for a
            solid foundation to innovate on. Companies become Linaro members in
            order to work with Linaro and other industry leaders on common
            projects. Strategy and roadmaps are discussed and agreed before
            Linaro's engineers, together with member company engineers,
            collaborate to deliver the solution. Collaborating on common
            projects reduces overall software fragmentation, allowing member
            companies to reduce their costs for development and validation of
            Arm-based software.

          text: Over the years Linaro has brought companies together to identify business
            opportunities and enable new markets on Arm architecture. This has
            resulted in multiple Linaro groups focused on specific verticals
            that now includes Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Vehicles,
            Consumer, Datacenter & Cloud, Edge & Fog Computing and IoT &
            Embedded. In 2016 Linaro created 96Boards, a range of hardware
            specifications which are open and define a standard board layout for
            SoC-agnostic development platforms - making the latest Arm-based
            processors available to developers at a reasonable cost. For more
            information on 96Boards, go to
            [www.96Boards.org](https://www.96boards.org).
