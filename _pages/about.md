            Linaro has driven open source software development on Arm since
            2010, providing the tools, Linux kernel quality and security needed
            for a solid foundation to innovate on. Linaro works with member
            companies and the open source community to maintain the Arm software
            ecosystem and enable new markets on Arm architecture.


            As technology has evolved, so has Linaro. While we continue to help maintain and evolve the Arm software ecosystem through the work we do on the [Linux kernel](https://www.linaro.org/core-technologies/linux-kernel/), [toolchains](https://www.linaro.org/core-technologies/toolchain/), [security](https://www.linaro.org/core-technologies/security/) and [continuous integration testing](https://www.linaro.org/core-technologies/testing-and-ci/), we also work across several markets to enable Arm technology. These include [Automotive, IoT & Edge Devices](https://www.linaro.org/automotive-iot-and-edge-devices/), [Client Devices](https://www.linaro.org/client-devices/) and [Cloud Computing & Servers](https://www.linaro.org/cloud-computing-and-servers/).
