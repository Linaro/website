            Linaro’s Datacenter & Cloud Group aims to, together with its members, provide a common development
            center for the Arm enterprise ecosystem. Working together to resolve common issues and develop standards
            reduces fragmentation and helps all participating companies deliver their products to market faster.

            The Linaro Edge and Fog Computing group and its members have joined forces to make this hybridization a
            reality through two major efforts:

            * Trusted Substrate - a reference implementation of the Embedded Base Board Requirement (EBBR)
            firmware specification from Arm.
            * LEDGE Reference Platform - a Generic Kernel Image industrial ready Linux (a single bootable image can
            run on any EBBR compliant board).
