    Linaro’s work is at the heart of all modern Linux-based devices running on Arm processors, including Android smartphones and tablets. As markets for Arm processors develop, new opportunities for collaborative engineering are created around Linux and other open source operating systems. This has resulted in Linaro’s collaborative engineering spanning a wide range of technologies. To find out more about what work we do in each vertical, click on the relevant icon.

                Linaro was formed to consolidate foundational Arm software. Over the years, Linaro has entered new verticals as and when collaborative engineering has been needed to enable new markets on Arm architecture.

                Linaro engineers work together with member company engineers on Arm software. Strategy and roadmaps are developed in technical steering committees which then decide what engineering work needs to happen when.

                Our work and expertise spans a wide range of areas:
