            There are multiple ways you can partner with Linaro - be it in collaboration with Linaro and
            other Linaro members or on a one-to-one basis. In addition, a lot of the work we do is in the
            open, meaning anything we think can benefit the community at large we will make public on
            our [Downloads page](/downloads/).
