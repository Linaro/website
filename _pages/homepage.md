            Linaro membership allows you to shape the future of Arm software
            together with Linaro and other industry leaders. Collaborating on
            common projects significantly reduces software fragmentation across
            the many Arm platforms, enabling participating companies and the
            community to reduce their costs for development and validation of
            Arm-based software.
