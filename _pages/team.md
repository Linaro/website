The direction of Linaro is determined by its [board of directors](/about/team/board/), formed from representatives of member companies and the CEO of Linaro. Execution of long-term objectives and delivery of nearer term development roadmaps is assigned to the [Linaro executive management team](/about/team/executive/), [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](/about/team/technical-steering-committee/) and segment group steering committees. The TSC includes senior engineers from each of the Linaro member companies, a representative from each segment engineering group, plus Linaro’s CTO and VP of engineering. Under the management team and steering committees, Linaro’s engineering team is split into [Core Engineering](/engineering/core/), [Developer Services](/services/) and [Segment Groups](/engineering/).
