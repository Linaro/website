            ## Linaro Membership


            Being a [Linaro](https://www.linaro.org/about/) member means collaborating on projects which help enable new markets on Arm and solve

            common problems. Collaboration significantly reduces software fragmentation across the many Arm

            platforms, enabling participating companies and the community to reduce their costs for development and

            validation of Arm-based software.


            **In practise, there are two parts to being a Linaro member.** 


            One part is the technical discussions with Linaro and other industry leaders in which roadmaps

            and strategy are developed and agreed.


            The other part is the collaborative engineering which then takes place between Linaro, member

            engineers and the open source community to deliver these solutions.


            **In this sense what we offer is unique** - a forum where actual software engineering happens as a result of

            member companies collaborating with Linaro’s Arm software experts, other industry leaders and the open

            source community.


            In addition to Linaro membership there are other ways of engaging with Linaro. If you need help building a product on Arm and want to leverage Linaro’s Arm and open source expertise, then partnering with [Linaro Developer Services](https://www.linaro.org/services/) is the right option for you.  


            Or if you simply want to access any of Linaro's releases you can find these on our [Downloads page](https://www.linaro.org/downloads/). We also provide support to the community in addition to our members and services customers. To submit a support query go to the [Linaro Support](https://www.linaro.org/support/) page.

            ## What is the value of becoming a Linaro member?
