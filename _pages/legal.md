              ### 2. INTRODUCTION


              The purpose of this Linaro Intellectual Property Policy ("IP Policy") is to set out the

              general principles under which Linaro will:


              a) accept Contributions;

              b) redistribute Contributions; and

              c) manage other intellectual property matters.


              By signing the Subscription Agreement, Members agree to comply with this IP Policy.

              In addition, this IP Policy shall serve as the basis for how non-Members interact with

              Linaro through participation in a Linaro Project.


              ### 3. ACCEPTING CONTRIBUTIONS (IN-BOUND LICENSING) AND UPSTREAM LICENSES


              When selecting upstream projects to form the basis of a Linaro Project or for inclusion in

              Linaro staging release or hosting development of new open source software components

              and accepting Contributions the emphasis in selection will be on the quality of code and

              community support for such project. However Linaro will only consider software for

              inclusion in Linaro Projects or in Linaro staging release and will only host development of

              new open source software and/or accept Contributions if the license under which such

              software is distributed has been approved as follows;


              (a) Software licensed under the Eclipse Public License (EPL), GNU General Public

              License version 2.x (GPL), GNU Library or “Lesser” Public License version 2.x

              (LGPL), Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL), Massachusetts Institute of Technology

              (MIT) or simplified Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) or under any other

              license that is subsequently approved by the Technical Steering Committee and

              the Board for automatic approval shall be automatically approved;


              (b) Software licensed under any other Open Source Initiative ("OSI") approved

              software licenses shall be subject to the unanimous approval of the Technical

              Steering Committee; and


              (c) Software licensed under any other license terms and conditions or that has not

              received unanimous approval under paragraph 3(b) above but had not been

              unanimously rejected shall be subject to the approval of the Board (or the

              Board’s designee specifically authorized for this responsibility) and the Technical

              Steering Committee will, when referring such software to the Board provide the

              Board with a summary of their discussions and, where relevant, a record of the

              votes made for and against such software.


              Software that is unanimously rejected by the Technical Steering Committee under

              paragraph 3(b) shall not be required to be referred to the Board.


              All license requests shall be recorded by the Technical Steering Committee and the

              Technical Steering Committee and the Board shall review the licence requests granted

              and outstanding at such regular intervals as the Technical Steering Committee or the

              Board shall determine.


              #### Choice of Project License


              ##### Existing Open Source Projects


              A significant focus of Linaro will be the integration of upstream open source software

              projects into a staging release. To minimise variances between the upstream projects

              and such release, Linaro wishes to contribute back to the relevant upstream projects and

              where successful in that endeavour will contribute back under the licenses already

              established for those upstream projects. Notwithstanding this ultimate aim, Linaro

              Projects will, at least transiently, be hosting patches to relevant upstream projects and these Linaro

              Projects will accept Contributions under the licenses already established for those upstream projects.


              ##### Securing Rights


              The mechanisms by which Linaro will obtain rights to Contributions sufficient to distribute

              them are:


              (a) under the Subscription Agreements;

              (b) under express license grants in relevant open source licenses; or

              (c) as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Contributor and the Board.


              ### 4. REDISTRIBUTING CONTRIBUTIONS (OUT-BOUND LICENSING)


              #### Existing Open Source Projects


              The license for distribution of software created in a Linaro Project and which is based on

              software from an existing open source software project will be compatible with the

              outbound license of the existing open source software project under which the code was

              received by Linaro.


              #### New Open Source Projects


              The license for distribution of software created in a Linaro Project not based on software

              from an existing open source software project will be compatible with the licenses

              approved in accordance with part 3 of this schedule.


              ### 5. CONFIDENTIALITY


              The Member(s) and other parties may exchange information as a result of their

              participation in Linaro and/or generally in the furtherance of the Objective (defined in the

              Membership Rules) of Linaro. All such information shall be considered non-confidential

              and provided under terms consistent with this IP Policy. In the event confidential

              information needs to be shared, such confidential information shall be disclosed pursuant

              to a confidentiality agreement entered into by the participants in such disclosure.


              ### 6. TRADEMARKS AND LOGOS


              The use of trademarks and logos associated with Linaro shall be used in accordance with

              the then current Linaro Trademark Usage Guidelines.

              The defined terms in these Antitrust Guidelines shall have the same meanings given to them in

              these Rules.


              ### 1. BACKGROUND


              #### 1.1


              The Members, officers, Directors and the employees (each, a "Participant") of Linaro

              understand that all of Linaro’s meetings and activities will be conducted strictly in

              accordance with all relevant competition laws.


              #### 1.2


              As a reference and to assist in complying with the relevant competition laws, below is a

              summary of the principal competition law issues that may arise in the context of Linaro

              meetings or discussions. It is not meant to be a comprehensive analysis of the

              competition laws of every country, but it should alert participants to high-risk activities and

              the need to consult with a lawyer whenever they are in any doubt and before acting.

              Failure to respect the basic guidelines set out in this document could expose Linaro and

              each of its Participants to significant fines and/or criminal sanctions. It is the policy of

              Linaro that if any doubt exists as to whether it is permissible to discuss a particular topic

              or to engage in a particular practice, no further action is to be taken until the matter has

              been referred to legal counsel for guidance.


              #### 1.3


              All Participants should understand that the competition laws differ across jurisdictions and

              that these Guidelines are not meant to be a substitute for his or her consulting with legal

              counsel about appropriate conduct.


              ### 2. INTRODUCTION TO COMPETITION LAW


              #### 2.1


              Competition law seeks to promote competition between competitors with the goal of

              achieving benefits for consumers of products and services. Competitors are therefore

              prohibited from cooperating in ways that distort the competitive process and frustrate the

              aforementioned goal of competition law. Accordingly, under competition law, there are

              rules as to what types of information and topics can be legitimately discussed between

              competitors without giving rise to concerns that their conduct on the market is being

              aligned. A non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of topics that should not be

              discussed in the context of Linaro are set out in Section 3 of these guidelines.


              #### 2.2


              Moreover, when industry members (including Members of Linaro within an industry)

              develop and adopt technology, it is important for the process to be open and transparent.

              In addition, industry members (including Members of Linaro within an industry) should not

              enter into agreements that would result in competition being adversely affected. If a

              Linaro Member has any doubts about whether its conduct may restrict competition, they

              should seek legal advice.


              #### 2.3


              It should be noted that the range of subjects, issues and matters, which may be subject

              to the provisions of both national and international competition law, is enormous. There

              is no definitive list of matters or behaviour that would be considered "anti-competitive," although there are certain types of conduct that would be regarded as "egregious" violations of competition law irrespective of jurisdiction. Examples of such egregious

              violations of competition law are set out in Section 4 of these Guidelines.


              #### 2.4


              It is vital that Participants in Linaro are vigilant in ensuring that at no time are they

              involved in any behaviour that would be considered anti-competitive by the relevant

              authorities. Such vigilance is even more compelling given the heavy financial sanctions

              (and criminal in some jurisdictions) that exist for egregious breaches of competition law.


              #### 2.5


              Guidance relating to: (i) the types of information that should not be exchanged in the

              context of Linaro; (ii) agreements that would constitute egregious violations of

              competition law; (iii) the conduct of Participants in Linaro’s Councils and committees; and

              (iv) the general conduct of all Linaro meetings are set out below.


              ### 3. GUIDANCE RELATING TO INFORMATION EXCHANGES IN LINARO


              #### 3.1


              Under competition law, exchanges of information between competitors that would

              typically be regarded as commercially sensitive or confidential are not permitted because

              they may cause these competitors to coordinate or align their conduct, thus distorting the

              market. Exchanges of this type of information may also be seen as evidence of the

              existence of an anti-competitive agreement between the different parties that represents

              an egregious violation of competition law (examples of which are set out in Section 4).

              Participants in Linaro will therefore not discuss (seriously or in jest) or exchange

              information regarding the following:


              - Individual company prices, proposed price changes, price differentials, price levels,

              pricing patterns or policies, pricing plans or terms and conditions of sale affecting price

              such as mark-ups, discounts, allowances, promotions, or credit terms.

              - Individual company data on costs, production plans, capacity, inventory, sales data, profit

              margins, or other data from which a competitor could discern prices.

              - Individual company policies relating to current or future strategy, including investment,

              technology, research and development, production, distribution, or marketing (including

              advertising) of particular products.

              - Individual company bids for particular customers or company procedures for responding

              to bid invitations or any other data relating to existing customers.

              - Industry pricing policies, price levels, price changes, pricing procedures, profit margins, or

              other data that relates to price.

              - Matters related to allocation of territories, allocation of customers, or restrictions on

              manufacturing or selling certain products.

              - Matters related to dealing or not dealing with a competitor, supplier, or customer that

              might have the effect of excluding them from any market or influencing the business

              conduct of firms toward them.

              4268669-21 46


              #### 3.2


              Any proposals regarding statistical, benchmarking or other survey programmes for Linaro

              should not be discussed until legal advice has been sought and obtained.


              ### 4. GUIDANCE RELATING TO AGREEMENTS THAT REPRESENT EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS OF COMPETITION LAW


              #### 4.1


              Certain types of agreements between independent enterprises are regarded as

              constituting egregious violations of competition law because they distort competition and

              adversely affect customers. The main examples of such conduct are set out below.

              However, the list of agreements and practices set out below is not exhaustive.


              #### 4.2


              It is important to note that the meaning of "agreement" in the context of competition law is

              very broad. An agreement need not be expressly stated or in writing; for the purposes of

              competition law, an agreement may be deemed to exist with no formal offer or

              acceptance. An agreement may be proven entirely by indirect or circumstantial evidence,

              e.g., competitors exchanging price lists at meetings of a trade association or other

              industry body. Communications among competitors are often used as circumstantial

              evidence of the existence of an agreement. Anything an employee says or writes to a

              competitor can be used as evidence in action against the company or the individual

              concerned. For the avoidance of doubt, "off the record" conversations or a "gentleman’s

              agreement" or "standard industry practice" will not enable any party to evade the general

              prohibition under competition law.


              **(A) Price Fixing**


              #### 4.3


              Price-fixing agreements between competitors, often called "cartels," are the most

              frequently prosecuted competition law violation.


              #### 4.4


              Virtually every developed country prohibits price-fixing agreements. The penalties for

              engaging in such conduct are typically financial, although in certain jurisdictions (most

              notably the United States and the United Kingdom), criminal sanctions may also apply,

              resulting in substantial prison sentences for those individuals who are found to have

              violated competition law.


              #### 4.5


              The prohibition against price fixing applies broadly to any understanding or agreement

              that has the effect of raising, lowering, or stabilizing prices among competitors, including

              agreements on the following:


              - Prices or discounts;

              - Margins;

              - Credit terms;

              - Promotional programs; and

              - Other terms and conditions of sale.


              #### 4.6


              It is also illegal for companies to enter into an agreement with their customers to set the

              resale price (known as resale price maintenance) of a product.


              **(B) Allocation of Supply or partitioning of Markets**


              #### 4.7


              Agreements among competitors or potential competitors to allocate supply or partition

              markets are just as serious as price fixing. These include agreements between

              competitors concerning the:


              - Quantities of goods that are to be purchased, produced, or marketed;

              - Geographic areas into which they will sell;

              - Customers to whom they will sell;

              - Market share each firm will achieve; and

              - Products they will sell.


              **(C) Group Boycotts**


              #### 4.8


              Group boycotts refer to understandings or agreements by two or more Persons to refrain

              from dealing with another party or only to deal under certain terms. These types of

              agreements will generally be illegal if the agreement 1) is designed to exclude a

              competitor from a trade association or a standards-setting group where membership is

              necessary for that firm to compete effectively in the relevant market or 2) has the purpose

              or effect of raising prices or reducing competition. Similarly, rules of industry associations

              that prevent or restrict members from dealing with competing bodies, suppliers or

              technologies may be illegal if they adversely affect competition. In addition, agreements

              among competitors or firms on different levels of the distribution chain are illegal if the

              purpose or effect of the boycott is to allocate markets or raise prices.


              ### 5. GUIDANCE GOVERNING PARTICIPATION IN LINARO


              5.1 Linaro has been established to be the leading consumer-focused open source enabling

              distribution, driving innovation across vertical segments, and deployed by the industry's

              leading OEM, operator and semiconductor companies. In achieving this goal, it has been

              determined that:


              - membership in Linaro shall be determined only on the basis of the objective and nondiscriminatory criteria specified in the Membership Criteria;

              - any recommendations arising out of any Working Groups that are adopted are based on

              objective criteria and interpreted objectively and accurately;

              - decisions are not made by those unfamiliar with the objectives of Linaro and the basis on

              which decisions are made within Linaro;

              - the recommendations issued by any Working Groups accomplish Linaro’s goals and

              objectives in the least restrictive way; and

              - Participants should not enter into agreements that prevent them from participating in

              other industry bodies or from dealing in alternative technologies outside of Linaro.


              ### 6. RULES FOR LINARO MEETINGS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES


              Subject to the terms set out in these Rules, all meetings will follow these procedures:


              - A draft agenda will be prepared before each meeting of the Board and sent to Linaro’s

              legal counsel for review and approval.

              - Each meeting will begin with a statement from the Chairperson of that meeting that the

              Participants have agreed to follow these guidelines and copies will be available at the

              meetings for participants to review. All Participants should confirm that they are aware of

              and understand these Guidelines.

              - Discussions at meetings will follow the topics on the agenda. Members wishing to raise

              any topics for discussion should inform the Board at the time the agenda is prepared.

              Legal counsel will be consulted if a Participant has a concern about the direction of any

              discussion. Such discussion will cease until legal counsel has approved it.

              - Minutes will be drafted that accurately reflect the matters that occur at each meeting and

              will be sent to legal counsel and the Members for review before being made final.

              - If any Participant persists in discussing a prohibited subject as set out in these guidelines

              or any subject that raises competition law concerns, other Participants should leave the

              meeting. Where a Participant leaves a Linaro meeting, that Participant should make his

              or her departure obvious, stating the reasons for the departure.

              - All Participants should be careful in his or her choice of words at meetings; they should

              never, even in jest, use words that indicate that they approve of or have participated in

              prohibited conduct; they should avoid conjecture, exaggeration or colourful or ambiguous

              language that might be misinterpreted.


              ### 7. CONCLUSION


              #### 7.1


              This document contains guidelines and general advice to Members in relation to issues of

              competition law. In case of doubt, specific advice should always be sought. The

              extensive range of matters and behaviour that may be deemed anti-competitive should

              always be borne in mind. Failure to observe this principle may result in serious

              consequences for both Linaro and its member Participants. It is incumbent on all

              Participants at all times, not just Chairmen of meetings or working groups to follow the

              specific rules and advice contained in this document. Respecting these Guidelines is

              to the benefit of all Participants in Linaro.
