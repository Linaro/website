            Since 2010, Linaro has played a key role in upstreaming Arm
            software, with many of its engineers actively maintaining open
            source projects. This page provides links to downloads currently
            produced by Linaro’s engineering teams.

            The official Arm releases of the pre-built GNU cross-toolchain for
            AArch64 and ARM 32-bit A-Profile cores are now available on the [Arm
            Developer
            website](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads).


            Linaro also provides monthly [GNU Toolchain Integration Builds](https://snapshots.linaro.org/gnu-toolchain/) which offer users a snapshot of the upstream build. These builds allow developers to test features from a pre-built binary as soon as it is upstream.

            The official community releases of the pre-built LLVM native
            toolchain for AArch64 and ARM 32-bit A-Profile cores are built and
            tested by Linaro and are now available on [LLVM’s
            GitHub](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/).


            In addition to the usual Linux-hosted LLVM toolchain, Linaro is now providing [official LLVM Toolchain for Windows on Arm](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-12.0.0/LLVM-12.0.0-woa64.exe) starting with LLVM 12.0.0 release.


            Interested in Cortex-R and Cortex-M bare-metal targeted toolchains for Arm embedded processors? We’re working with Arm to supply a new release every year (with quarterly updates). Releases are maintained for two years. You can get these directly from [the Arm website](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm).

            The Linaro Automated Validation Architecture (LAVA) is a test and
            continuous integration framework that Linaro uses to validate its
            releases. The source is open so that Linaro member companies and
            others can create their own instantiations and run proprietary tests
            within this standard framework.


            The two recommended ways to install Lava is either via DEB or Docker:

            SQUAD is a web based reporting tool. It was created by Linaro to
            cover basic test result reporting for Linaro teams. It can collect
            pass/fail results and benchmarks from direct submissions or from
            testing tools like LAVA.

            [TuxSuite™](https://tuxsuite.com/) delivers on-demand APIs and tools
            for building and testing Linux kernels in parallel. Created by
            Linaro, Tuxsuite is the backbone of our testing efforts and is
            available to anyone interested in doing Linux kernel testing faster
            and on a wider scale.


            You can either [download the TuxSuite client](https://docs.tuxsuite.com/#install-and-configure) to use Linaro’s TuxSuite service, or you can download the backend tools to run on your own.


            Tuxmake automates Linux builds across different architectures, configurations, targets, and toolchains. Specify your choices, and TuxMake drives the build for you, doing the same steps in the same way every time. [Download Tuxmake here](https://tuxmake.org/#installing-tuxmake).


            Tuxrun automates booting and testing Linux under QEMU. It supports almost all architectures supported by TuxMake. [Download Tuxrun here](https://tuxrun.org/install-pypi/).

            Linaro releases a set of Linux software builds for platforms based
            on Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, such as Dragonboard 410c,
            Qualcomm Robotics RB3 or RB5. The releases from Linaro are based on
            the Linux mainline kernel and rely upon open-source user space
            packages exclusively. Linaro provides Yocto Project and Debian based
            reference implementations. More information on the supported
            platforms can be found on the [96boards.org
            website](https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/dragonboard/).
