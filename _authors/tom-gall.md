As past member of IBM's Linux Technology Center from 2000-2012, I have worked on and led the IBM embedded Linux team. I worked on libraries to accelerate the PowerEN hardware accelerators for Linux. I founded and led the Gentoo-ppc64 team 2003-2010. Prior to 2000, I helped implement the Java Virtual Machine for the AS/400. My interests include android, iOS and the creation of games using OpenGL ES, OGRE and Unity3D.
