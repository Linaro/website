Anders hates running tests and therefore he loves automating them. He has been working with Linux kernels for telecommunication (e.g. base stations, media gateways) as well as various drivers and RTOS’s for automotive systems (e.g. engine-, gearbox-platforms). He has also experience from NFV/Openstack.
