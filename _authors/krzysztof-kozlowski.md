Krzysztof Kozlowski is an active Linux Kernel developer, working currently for Linaro on upstream development of Qualcomm ARM/ARM64 SoCs. Krzysztof maintains several upstream kernel subsystems: Devicetree bindings (as a co-maintainer with Rob Herring), Memory controller drivers, NFC subsystem with drivers and Samsung Exynos SoC ARM/ARM64 architecture. He has made several contributions to the kernel, appearing in top-contributors for several releases and apparently he likes to convert the DT bindings to the YAML format. Recently he focuses on reviewing DT binding patches.
