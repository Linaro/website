Prior to joining Linaro as a Toolchain Engineer, I worked with system software, binary translation and embedded systems programming.\
Early in my career I spent 3 years as a System Analyst at AsGa, developing software for telecommunication equipments that ran a custom embedded Linux, using the C language.\
More recently, at Instituto de Pesquisas Eldorado, I worked with Open Source Software, making several contributions to FreeBSD, QEMU and LLVM, with the main goal of improving their support on PowerPC. There I also worked with management software for enterprise storage arrays and with a distributed storage system, both written in C++.
