Paolo Valente is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, and a collaborator of the Linaro engineering organization. Paolo's main activities focus on scheduling algorithms for storage devices, transmission links and CPUs. In this respect, Paolo is the author of the last version of the BFQ I/O scheduler. BFQ entered the Linux kernel from 4.12, providing unprecedented low-latency and fairness guarantees. As for transmission links, Paolo is one of the authors of the QFQ packet scheduler, which has been in the Linux kernel until 3.7, after that it has been replaced by QFQ+, a faster variant defined and implemented by Paolo himself. Finally, Paolo has also defined and implemented other algorithms, part of which are now in FreeBSD, and has provided new theoretic results on multiprocessor scheduling.
