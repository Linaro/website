Since early 2007, the UEFI Forum has been hosting 1-3 plugfests each year. Members of the
Forum are invited to participate in these interoperability testing events. Typically, system
vendors such as OEM/ODMs or Independent Firmware Vendors (IFVs) book test rooms at the
event venue and set up their systems (servers and PCs), Independent Hardware Vendors
(IHVs) take their peripheral devices (storage or network host bridge adapters, and graphics
cards, etc.) to the system vendors’ test rooms to test the interoperability. Operating System
Vendors (OSVs) sometimes alto take the latest versions of their OS images to test. The focus
of the tests is around the UEFI drivers, OS level device drivers and the OSes. These plugfests
have been extremely useful in successfully moving the x64 ecosystem to adopt the UEFI
technologies.

As we develop the Arm infrastructure ecosystem, it becomes very clear to us that taking
advantage of the UEFI plugfest to test the device interoperability with the Arm servers is
critical. Therefore, Arm and Linaro decided to sponsor the next event which is to take place
at the Capital Hotel Dahzi in Taipei on Oct 15, 2018 to Oct 19, 2018 hosted by American
Megatrends, Inc.

We encourage the Arm ecosystem partners (OEM/ODMs, SiPs, IHVs) to join us at the
plugfest to learn about the latest UEFI specification enhancements from technology experts
and sign-up to test your latest platforms, devices (both the UEFI drivers and the OS level
drivers, and firmware) during the private plugfest testing sessions.
