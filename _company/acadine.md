A completely web-centric operating system, H5OS eliminates the native APIs that give the conventional mobile OS owners full business control over other mobile industry participants. As a result, H5OS offers the huge potential of a simpler technical architecture, more efficient memory and power consumption, and completely dynamic and seamless interactions between the mobile operating system, on-device applications, and the millions of web apps and services on the Internet at large.

The H5OS open architecture also brings about an open mobile ecosystem with open participation, thus enabling choices for everyone, from device makers to operators to consumers, to freely select and experience the best of the web. For more information about our products, please visit www.acadine.com.
