    Dronecode helps nurture the open-source communities, guides project governance, provides infrastructure, and critical services to mass adoption. Some of it’s supported projects include PX4 Autopilot, MAVLink, QGroundControl, and MAVSDK. The PX4 Autopilot is the most widely adopted open-source flight controller. It has a complete ecosystem of components that has been driving industry standards for unmanned vehicles, ranging from protocols for onboard and intra-vehicular communications to UI and SDKs that provides full flight control and mission planning. Pixhawk open standards provide hardware specifications and guidelines for drone systems, such as the most advanced flight controllers in the industry, an ecosystem of payload interfaces, and smart battery management. The Dronecode foundation creates a sustainable collaboration framework for the ecosystems’ advancement and adoption. The entity is funded through yearly memberships by organizations that support open ecosystems and standards. Dronecode is part of the non-profit Linux Foundation.
