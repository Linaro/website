GCC is a non-profit social organization composed of all parties in the industrial chain, including technology providers, manufactures, system integrators and enterprise users, on the basis of voluntary, equal, mutually beneficial and cooperative. The aim of the alliance is to abide by national laws, regulations and policies, to conform to the development trend of information technology with open software and hardware, to pool the superior resources of the global industrial chain, and to provide more easily used and managed green energy-saving products for end-enterprise users on the basis of open technologies such as ARM computing chip technology.
