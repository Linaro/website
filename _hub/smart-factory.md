## The Smart Factory

The Smart factory is the result of the application of various connective technologies to achieve hyper-flexible and self-adapting manufacturing capabilities. Industry 4.0 describes the application of advanced sensors, embedded software, the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing and enhanced analytics to digitalise the manufacturing process.

Sensors and smart objects collect, collate and stream data. Data is continuously shared through connected machines, devices and production systems. Data is used to collaboratively optimise supply management, production efficiency and fault management in real-time.

Industrial IoT is simply an optimisation of typical IoT technologies for manaufacturing.to improve operational efficiency, control and visibility based on actionable metrics. Big Data and Analytics is employed to optimise AI and inform self-improving systems and processes.
