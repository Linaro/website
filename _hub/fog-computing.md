## FOG Computing

Fog computing is often regarded as analogous to Edge computing due to the history of the development of the terms. Further confusion arises because there is usually a commonality of hardware. However, in modern distributed networks a Fog layer can be distinguished between the Cloud and the Edge devices.

The Fog layer is an intelligent filtering and processing zone. Vast data streams from the Edge are analysed and decisions are made about routing. Some data is sent to the cloud for further processing and storage. Irrelevant data can simply be deleted. A portion is retained locally for further processing, for rapid access or to inform learning models. The role of Fog is to preserve cloud and networking resources and ensure the vast data flows from the Edge are exploited intelligently.
