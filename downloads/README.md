        <h3>Releases</h3>
        <p>
            Releases is the main repository for Linaro code that has been tested and released. It is possible to navigate down through this site to find code if you know what you are looking for, but we recommend you use the links below for our most popular downloads.

        <h3>Platforms</h3>
        <p>
            Platforms is a new site that will host platform builds for specific end-to-end solutions. Currently, this site features the 18.06 release of the Enterprise Reference Platform, but we expect to post additional platform builds in the coming months.

        <p>
            Snapshots code shows Linaro work in progress. Often created on a daily basis, these are literally snapshots of work in progress that are used for testing and development. The code on this site may not work and should only be used by experienced engineers who know exactly what they are doing.

        <h3>LKFT</h3>
        <p>
            LKFT is Linaro’s Linux Kernel Functional Test framework.
            The mission of LKFT is to perform functional regression testing on select Linux kernel branches in real time (as they’re updated) and report any regressions as quickly as possible. This is performed by executing a variety of functional-tests on a selection of user-space operating systems

Linaro code exists in many states and is found in many places. Working upstream means that the ultimate goal for most code is to be accepted and incorporated into something like the Linux kernel or GCC tool chain. The [Patches website](http://patches.linaro.org/) presents this work by team and by upstream project.

Before the code gets accepted upstream, Linaro maintains various development repositories and Linaro's groups make regular releases of various builds including Android, the LAVA test framework, key toolchains and builds for specific member products.

This page provides links to many of the more popular downloads produced by Linaro's [engineering teams](https://www.linaro.org/work/).

## Linaro Security Working Group downloads (including latest work on Meltdown/Spectre)

[Linaro security downloads](https://www.linaro.org/downloads/security/) are available from several of Linaro's engineering groups. The most recent work includes collaboration on Meltdown/Spectre fixes backported in to the 4.4, 4.9 and 4.14 kernels. There are also links to the latest OP-TEE work from the Security Working Group.


## Linaro Member Builds

LMBs are full system builds of popular open-source products set up at the request of a Linaro Core/Club [Member](/membership/) company.

## Linaro Toolchain

The first Arm release of the pre-built GNU cross-toolchain for Cortex-A GCC 8.2-2018.08 is now available on the [Arm Developer website](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a).

Linaro provides monthly [GCC source archive](https://snapshots.linaro.org/components/toolchain/gcc-linaro/) snapshots of the current Linaro GCC release branch, as well as quarterly releases of pre-built Linaro [GNU cross-toolchain binary archives](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/).

The following tables provide direct access to the most common Linux and bare-metal ABI variants of the Linaro binary cross-toolchain quarterly releases.  Both x86_64 Linux and Mingw32 (MS Windows compatible) host binaries are provided:

Interested in other target ABIs such as big-endian or soft-float little-endian? All toolchain target ABI and host variants can be seen [here](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest-7/). _Note: Not all ABI and host variants are supported to the same degree. See the [release-notes](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest-7/) for more information._

Interested in Cortex-R and Cortex-M bare-metal targeted toolchains for Arm embedded processors? We’re working with Arm to also supply a new release every year (with quarterly updates). Releases are maintained for two years. Get these [directly from the Arm website](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
