# About Reference Platforms

The goal of Linaro Reference Platforms (RPs) is to provide product quality, end to end, documented, open source platforms for market segment or use cases, comprising boot firmware, kernel, distribution(s) and additional relevant open source projects. RPs are built and tested on 96Boards RP-Certified hardware and (for the Enterprise RP) the Linaro Developer Cloud. The RPs are intended to be reference examples for use as a foundation for products based on open source technologies.
