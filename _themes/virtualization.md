    From faster turnaround to reduced downtime and
    costs, the benefits of virtualization are clear to see.

    Virtualization can be used for almost any use case, with it playing an ever more prominent
    role in up and coming technologies such as autonomous driving. Linaro plays a key role in QEMU - an
    open source hypervisor. Not only do Linaro employees and assignees act as main-
    tainers for Arm-specific areas of the codebase but we also take care of areas such as TCG 
    code-generation, build and test automation, and release management. In addition to our work
    in QEMU, we are also driving the project Stratos, which is developing hypervisor agnostic
    Virtio interfaces and standards to address richer ecosystems such as automotive, and IoT.

                QEMU is a free open-source emulator and virtualizer. Linaro
                plays a key role in the project ensuring the ARM ecosystem is
                well represented and actively maintained. We leverage our
                expertise as maintainers to support the upstreaming of new
                features from members and the wider community. We
                consistently rank in the top three of companies that participate
                in the development of this well respected project.

                There is a growing trend towards virtualization in areas other
                than the traditional server environment. The server enviroment
                is uniform in nature but as we move towards a richer
                ecosystem in automotive, medical and general mobile and IoT
                spaces, the rich array of hypervisors and SoCs become a
                problem. Project Stratos is working towards developing
                hypervisor agnostic Virtio interfaces and standards.
