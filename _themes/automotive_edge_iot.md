    Software defined functionality is no longer
    restricted to the cloud network but is now
    expected to extend to the edge.

    Autonomous AI-driven features are being deployed to positions of trust in
    gateways and even sensors.The Zonal Architecture revolution driving the evolution
    to software-defined vehicles is just one indicator that industry has switched to a
    software-first methodology. The technologies underpinning these use cases are
    continuously evolving but all suffer from one common denominator - the lack of
    open software standardization.

            ## Open standards for Automotive, IoT & Edge solutions

            The shift to software-first methodology, coupled with advances in
            artificial intelligence has the potential to create a world in which
            our devices are always connected, communicate with one another
            and are driven by intelligent decision making. But in order to realize
            the full potential of an always connected, always online world,
            standardization is key. Linaro works with member companies on
            developing open standards and interfaces which will help
            accelerate and secure deployment of their Automotive, IoT and
            Edge solutions.

                There is a growing trend towards
                virtualization in areas other than the
                traditional server environment. The
                server enviroment is uniform in nature
                but as we move towards a richer
                ecosystem in automotive, medical and
                general mobile and IoT spaces, the rich
                array of hypervisors and SoCs become
                a problem. Project Stratos is working
                towards developing hypervisor

                Lite Micro. The aim of this project is to
                enable inference workloads on Arm

                The Heterogeneous Platform project is focused on software that allows the different core types or OS types to work together and creates a standards based framework to make the system developers job easier. The majority of Automotive SOCs use multiple CPU core types. Adding M profile or R profile cores to a SOC with A profile cores, allows the A profile cores to focus on the Linux tasks it is designed for, while M/R cores can focus on low latency sense/control loops, isolated security, or increased safety.
