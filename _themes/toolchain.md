    Toolchains continue to evolve as new SoC features are
    added. Speed and space optimisations are increasingly
    important, especially in the IoT space. New security
    features need compiler and tool support.

    The world is rapidly changing, and as a result the open software on computing systems is having to accommodate a shift to greater use
    of machine learning, increasing mobile CPU performance. Linaro has provided open source tools for Arm architectures since its
    inception in 2010, working directly with upstream communities such as GCC, Binutils, GDB, Glibc, Newlib, LLVM, Clang, LLD, LLDB,
    QEMU, Valgrind and OpenOCD. Our mission is to improve and maintain open-source Arm toolchain projects.

    We work on all aspects of system-level tools - the core development toolchain (compiler, assembler, linker, debugger), core system
    libraries (dynamic linker, c-library), and emulation.Linaro builds and tests LLVM community integration releases for ARM and AArch64
    architectures (http://releases.llvm.org/download.html). Linaro maintainers serve as release managers for QEMU and Glibc project.

                The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a compiler system
                produced by the GNU Project. It supports various
                programming languages and is a key component of the GNU
                toolchain. It is the the standard compiler for most projects
                related to GNU and Linux, including the Linux kernel. This
                Linaro project focuses on improving optimizations for popular
                Arm cores, supporting compiler sanitizers, supporting new
                Armv8 architectural features and improving the debugging
                experience.

                LLVM is one of the main tools the open-source community
                uses to compile their code. It is a set of reusable compiler and
                toolchain technologies which are used to develop front ends
                for any programming language and back ends of any
                instruction set architecture. LLDB is the debugger component
                of the LLVM project. The Linaro toolchain team actively
                maintains the LLDB project and has ownership of Arm and
                AArch64 target specific code base. We implement new and
                improve existing code-size and code-speed optimizations for
                AArch64 and Arm targets.
