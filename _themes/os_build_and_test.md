            **Firmware, Kernel, File-System, System Libraries, and Toolchains. These are colloquially known as an operating system.**

            Linaro provides the software tools to rapidly detect build and functional-test regressions in Linux, Android, Zephyr, and
            other operating systems against a variety of emulated and hardware targets (IoT, embedded, and server).

            Linaro members are privileged to participate in a variety of activities that improve operating system software on their
            devices. They participate in the Linaro Linux Kernel Quality program, deploy landing teams that specialize in keeping their
            product Linux kernels current and upstream, work with Linaro to enable device automation in LAVA, and utilize Linaro’s
            scalable build and testing solutions to routinely test Linux on their devices.

            Linaro member companies even build their own communities around testing in Linaro through Linaro directed projects.
            Linaro members spend more time focusing on differentiating technology and are able to have testing teams that can focus
            on last-mile testing by working directly with Linaro.

              Linaro maintains Linaro member-directed programs to improve the quality of the Zephyr, Linux, and Android
              operating-systems. We work with upstream developers and release maintainers to accelerate availability of security and
              bug fixes and improve the quality of stable releases (by detecting regressions before release), improve the frequency of
              product device updates through increasing quality confidence, and improve the breadth of testing available to developers
              and device manufacturers before they commit their code to releases.

              Linaro’s Linux Kernel Quality program covers both Linux
              kernel testing and testing of the LTS-derived
              Android-Common Kernel. Linaro’s Linux Kernel Functional
              Testing framework (LKFT) is the most reliable Linux long-term-stable functional test framework in the industry. On a weekly
              basis, across the latest 6 Linux LTS releases, the linux-next branch and
              linux-mainline branches, Linaro build-tests and reports on over 350
              release+architecture+target combinations on every git-branch push. We
              run functional-testing on nearly 40 of these combinations on real and
              emulated hardware and report back consistently with results in under 48 hours. We have run over 156 Million Test runs of
              the Linux LTS trees to date against a variety of embedded, emulated, and server platforms. We work weekly with LTS
              maintainers to execute testing and report regressions on the latest release-candidates before the releases are made.

              ![LKFT content 2](/assets/images/content/530m_tests.png){:.medium-inline.left}

              We also build and functional test (Android CTS & VTS) Android Common
              Kernels weekly and report regressions in the Linux kernel and AOSP
              directly to Linux upstream maintainers and Google respectively. To date
              we’ve run over 530 Million Test runs against a variety of mobile chipsets,
              preventing regressions before they ever hit production mobile devices.

              TuxSuite™ by Linaro is the backbone of our Linaro’s testing efforts. This is now available as a
              commercial service to help anyone interested in improving their Linux kernel testing to do so rapidly and
              at scale. Take your testing from limited and infrequent to constant and expansive with TuxSuite.

            content: |
              Linaro maintains a variety of open source project CI and testing frameworks. Centralising the testing in Linaro alleviates the
              members need to individually monitor the upstream community. Linaro toolchain testing helps ensure that Arm devices
              remain at the forefront of the performance envelope in terms of generated code size and the execution performance of the
              resulting code.

              To achieve this Linaro provides support to a number of CI artifacts:-

              #### GNU Toolchain build and integration testing

              Integration release testing builds

              - These builds are made from the master branches of GNU toolchain components at the moment the
              moment build, you can interrogate the included manifests for details.
              - These builds are for experimental environments only, providing support for system integrators to
              check an upcoming GNU official release.
