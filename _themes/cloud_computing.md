  The traditional data center is transitioning from on-premise server racks to cloud technologies in third party data centers. Accelerated by the pandemic and the need for remote work, datacenter and cloud infrastructure are expected to deliver more connectivity faster - while remaining secure. To help achieve this, Linaro works with member companies to make key open source projects enabled for Arm-based servers. The work we do ensures the Arm server ecosystem can rely on quality software.

    The past few years have seen Arm being adopted more and more in the server space,
    with the world’s fastest supercomputer - Fujitsu’s Fugaku - running on Arm CPUs.

    It is a well known fact that Arm chips have dominated the mobile market. The flexibility
    Arm offers device manufacturers who can design Arm chips to meet specific needs make it
    an attractive choice. But for Arm server chips to continue to meet the demands of
    businesses needing more storage and more data, there needs to be a software ecosystem
    in place that helps drive feature enablement, testing and bug fixing. Linaro works together
    with its member companies on strengthening the software ecosystem for Arm servers.

            ## Making Arm a first class citizen

            Linaro, together with its member companies, is working on
            making key open source projects enabled for Arm-based
            servers. We refer to this as making Arm a first class citizen. By
            verifying the projects build continuously, get tested and have
            binaries available for Arm server targets, the Arm ecosystem is
            able to depend on quality software for use in production
            environments.

                Technology for servers is continuously
                evolving. For the boot architecture, this
                means the AArch64 boot process should
                use familiar tools already in common use
                and active development. The Arm Server
                Architecture project predominantly
                focuses on Arm UEFI, GRUB2 and
                related components.

                With 90% of all data having been
                created in the last two years, Big Data
                and Data Science technologies are vital
                and have become mature with various
                production implementations. Linaro
                drives engineering activities and ARMv8
                builds for projects such as Apache
                BigTop, Hadoop, Spark, Ambari and Drill.
