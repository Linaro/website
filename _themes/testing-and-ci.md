    Linaro provides the software tools to rapidly detect build

    and functional-test regressions in Linux, Android, Zephyr,

    and other operating systems against a variety of emulated

    and hardware targets (IoT, embedded, and server).


    Linaro members are privileged to participate in a variety of activities that improve operating

    system software on their devices. They participate in the Linaro Linux Kernel Quality program,

    deploy landing teams that specialize in keeping their product Linux kernels current and

    upstream, work with Linaro to enable device automation in LAVA, and utilize Linaro’s scalable

    build and testing solutions to routinely test Linux on their devices.


    Linaro member companies even build their own communities around testing in Linaro through

    Linaro directed projects. Linaro members spend more time focusing on differentiating

    technology and are able to have testing teams that can focus on last-mile testing by working

    directly with Linaro.

                LAVA is the open source Linaro Automation and Validation
                Architecture. It is the industry standard software for embedded
                device and testing automation, but also works with IoT and
                server-grade devices. It can perform firmware, OS (boot and
                functional), application, and producer-consumer testing. Being
                the creators of LAVA, Linaro has over a decade of experience
                refining this automation software. Linaro’s members guide
                development of represents member interest.

                Linaro’s Linux Kernel Quality program covers both Linux kernel

                testing and testing of the LTS-derived Android-Common Kernel.

                Linaro’s Linux Kernel Functional Testing framework (LKFT) is

                the most reliable Linux long-term-stable functional test

                framework in the industry. On a weekly basis, across the latest

                6 Linux LTS releases, the linux-next branch and linux-mainline

                branches, Linaro build-tests and reports on over 350

                release+architecture+target combinations on every git-branch

                push. We run functional-testing on nearly 40 of these

                combinations on real and emulated hardware and report back

                consistently with results in under 48 hours. We have run over

                156 Million Test runs of the Linux LTS trees to date against a

                variety of embedded, emulated, and server platforms. We work

                weekly with LTS maintainers to execute testing and report

                regressions on the latest release-candidates before the releases

                are made.


                We also build and functional test (Android CTS & VTS) Android

                Common Kernels weekly and report regressions in the Linux

                kernel and AOSP directly to Linux upstream maintainers and

                Google respectively. To date we’ve run over 530 Million Test

                runs against a variety of mobile chipsets, preventing regressions

                before they ever hit production mobile devices. Explore Linaro’s

                SQUAD is Linaro’s open source Software Quality Dashboard

                software. It is cloud-deployable and scalable software for

                scheduling, aggregating, the collection of software test-results,

                and presenting them directly via reporting front-end, or via the

                reporting API for customer results composition. SQUAD is also

                able to maintain software baselines, perform results

                comparisons, and generate email reports using project

                templates. It supports mixed-tenant results with a permission

                and access layer that can give granular access to public and

                private data separately.
