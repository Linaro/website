    Linaro employs a significant number of
    maintainers covering a wide range of important
    areas. This allows us to reach far within open
    source communities and have a real impact.

    We actively contribute to the upstream community and help facilitate
    acceptance of Linaro code into the Linux mainline kernel. Our ultimate goal is to
    ensure kernel consolidation - a single source tree with integrated support for
    multiple Arm SoCs and Arm-based platforms.

    We manage and implement support of new features not only dedicated to Arm
    architecture but also covering core functionalities of the kernel. In the tradition
    of Linux and the open source community, much of the technical discussiontakes
    place over email and informal conversations on IRC.

                Over the years devices have become more compact and
                powerful yet batteries are more constrained. Linaro’s
                Performance Project aims to improve the efficiency of all Arm
                based Linux systems by improving Linux subsystems such as
                the scheduler, thermal framework and traditional power
                management subsystems. These subsystems influence
                performance of power consumption and help systems use
                power budget efficiently while reaching maximum
                performance. This prevents systems from overheating and
                crashing.

                SoC have shared and critical resources which are usually
                handled by a dedicated and secured power coprocessor (SCP).
                This dedicated processor is in charge of gathering requirements
                of the different subsystem/clients. However, some systems
                cannot afford a dedicated processor or do not have enough
                client channel for all possible subsystems. In such cases, an
                SCMI server must be able to run a different Execution
                environment than the usual cortex M bare metal. This Linaro
                project addresses those use cases.
