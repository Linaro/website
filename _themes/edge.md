Arm based Edge devices are used for inferencing or reinforced training. Edge has much in common with Arm Servers as many of the inference frameworks or the support libraries they depend on are in use on Arm based Edge devices. Beyond Cortex-A CPUs, hardware accelerators are common. Often improvements targeted for Arm Servers also benefit Arm Edge devices. While Linaro does not develop hardware acceleration, frameworks and libraries need to be designed and optimized with Arm devices and offload in mind for peak efficiency and performance.
