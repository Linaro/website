              Linaro was formed in 2010 to address the lack of standardization
              on foundational Arm software. Everyone was creating their own
              foundational software which was then only applicable to their
              platforms, resulting in extra engineering effort to make it
              applicable to other platforms. Linaro, together with other
              companies working on Arm-based technology, joined forces to create
              standards for kernel, toolchain and security. We solved the
              problems we set out to fix but as new technology continues to
              appear, there will always be a need for standardization to reduce
              engineering effort and thereby accelerate innovation.

              Linaro employs some of the world’s leading Arm software experts,
              with more than 60 software kernel maintainers looking after more
              than 100 open source projects. Since our inception, we have been
              continually ranked by LWN.net in the top ten companies which
              contribute to the Linux kernel - no small feat for a company with
              250 engineers! We are able to successfully and efficiently deliver
              standardized solutions for the Arm software ecosystem because our
              team of Engineers are highly experienced and well connected to the
              Open Source Community.

                  In order to become part of the
                  open source community, I felt it
                  was important to join our peers.
                  I believe we benefited greatly
                  from joining Linaro since we now
                  have a connection with various
                  communities including Linaro
                  and the Linux Community.

              Once needs have been identified and strategy agreed upon, Linaro
              engineers work with member engineers and the open source community
              to deliver the solutions. Sharing engineering resource
              significantly reduces overall development costs and helps
              accelerate time to market as more engineers - with different
              perspectives - are able to dedicate time to building software,
              problem solving and troubleshooting.
